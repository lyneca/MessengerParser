Jacob SalwayTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 10:11am UTC+10

Jacob SalwayTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 10:11am UTC+10
but sometimes when i drive she says she has a heart attack because of my driving

Jacob SalwayTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 10:11am UTC+10
and it makes my mum less stressed because she doesnt have to drive

Jacob SalwayTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 10:10am UTC+10
driving is an important skill to learn

Jacob SalwayTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 10:10am UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 10:10am UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 8:10am UTC+10

Claudio LuciniTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 8:10am UTC+10
Ugh, my boss's phone call woke me up, and now I get to go to work in 15 mins

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 8:09am UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 8:09am UTC+10

John SharplesMonday, June 29, 2015 at 10:15pm UTC+10

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 9:25pm UTC+10
I think I'm gonna make a ballista and point it down the main hallway

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10
Nah

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10
You'd think that the dwarves would make BUILDING THE BRIDGE INTO THE FORTRESS a high-priority job

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 9:18pm UTC+10
Me cook's been possessed

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 9:18pm UTC+10

Dunno

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:45pm UTC+10
and how do i turn it off?

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:45pm UTC+10
what trigonometric rendering am i going to be doing?

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:45pm UTC+10
If you ever get into Pygame and you start doing trigonometric display rendering, you're gonna have a LOT of things on one line

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:44pm UTC+10
It's line length

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:44pm UTC+10
It's not indenting

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:44pm UTC+10
well who indents that much anyway

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:44pm UTC+10
It's the PEP 8 for max chars in a line

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:43pm UTC+10
no

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:43pm UTC+10
Do you know what it is?

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:43pm UTC+10
well its annyoing me

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:43pm UTC+10
You can but don't

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:43pm UTC+10
You don't

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:43pm UTC+10
ok how do i get rid of this damn white line?

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:43pm UTC+10
Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
That's SUCH a shame

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
well thats all my brackets then

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
Only the things that are wrong

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
and it will underline everything?

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
or function function() {

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
And it's underlining your brackets because they're wrong

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
function function() {

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
It is

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
sounds like a coding standard

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
but if its going to underline all my brackets because it doesnt like them

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
Because I bet Sublime doesn't

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
no i dont know what pep 8 is

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
Do you know what PEP 8 is?

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
i mean sublime

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
and if i want linting i can get that in python

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
Aw you big baby :(

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
pycharm has second delays and it was annoying

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:37pm UTC+10
So is Pycharm

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:37pm UTC+10
sublime is blazing fast

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:37pm UTC+10
It's just like comparing nano and emacs

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:37pm UTC+10
What do you mean? Like Pycharm wanted you to actually be a programmer?

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
On both of those

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
what i mean is that pycharm didnt have enough improvement

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
Actually you're wrong

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
and sublime text looks better

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
and i found its codeintel wasn't as amazing

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
Pycharm is better

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
That's great

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
and has 20x less cpu usage lol

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:35pm UTC+10
sublime text is made in c++

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:35pm UTC+10
maybe it doesnt have to be made in java

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:35pm UTC+10
for a notebook cpu

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:35pm UTC+10
Pycharm is not slow on my computer

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:35pm UTC+10
ahem the macbook cpu is actually quite good

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:35pm UTC+10
Proof:

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:35pm UTC+10
is crap

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:35pm UTC+10
That's because your computer

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:35pm UTC+10
is made in damn java out of all things

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:35pm UTC+10
its too slow compared to sublime text

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:35pm UTC+10
Why

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:34pm UTC+10
as much as i want to love pycharm i just cant

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:27pm UTC+10
I am

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:27pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:24pm UTC+10
We didn't decide

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:24pm UTC+10
Reading over that, it barely makes sense

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:23pm UTC+10
So what time Wednesday?

Jacob SalwayMonday, June 29, 2015 at 7:16pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:34pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:34pm UTC+10

Claudio LuciniSunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:30pm UTC+10
9gag misses me

Claudio LuciniSunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:30pm UTC+10
Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:25pm UTC+10
or are we going to argue about hardware?

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:25pm UTC+10
ok heres why i think osx is better

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:23pm UTC+10
why the fuck are we arguing about opengl vs directx

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:23pm UTC+10
and more optimisation

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:23pm UTC+10
opengl is open source, allows for better integration with more platforms

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:22pm UTC+10

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:22pm UTC+10
psgl

Claudio LuciniSunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:22pm UTC+10
Ps4 probably uses its own graphics api

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:21pm UTC+10
but you dont buy a damn mac for gaming thats for sure

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:21pm UTC+10
maybe

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:21pm UTC+10
ps4 uses opengl i think

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:21pm UTC+10
directx is better for gaming yes

Claudio LuciniSunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:21pm UTC+10
I don't play android games on my computer

Claudio LuciniSunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:21pm UTC+10
Does that help a Mac?

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:21pm UTC+10
android doesnt use directx

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:21pm UTC+10
such as your phone?

Claudio LuciniSunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:21pm UTC+10
Such as?

Anastasia FeshinaSunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10
*proceeds to eat popcorn*

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10
such as every game for any platform other than windows?

Claudio LuciniSunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10
And a pretty terrible one

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10
directx is closed source windows only microsoft copyright

Claudio LuciniSunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10
Such as?

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10

Claudio LuciniSunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:18pm UTC+10
Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:18pm UTC+10

Claudio LuciniSunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:18pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaSunday, June 28, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:50pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:50pm UTC+10
Pycharm looks at your python config and AUTOMATICALLY UPDATES AUTOCOMPLETE BASED ON YOUR INSTALLED PACKAGES

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:49pm UTC+10
and does it require java like phpstorm does?

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:49pm UTC+10
You have NO idea

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:49pm UTC+10
does pycharm have pygame autocomplete?

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:49pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:46pm UTC+10

John SharplesSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:46pm UTC+10
SHUJT UP

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:46pm UTC+10
And it's the entire project

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:46pm UTC+10
It's just syncing to drive

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:43pm UTC+10
not sure how you've structured it

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:42pm UTC+10
just send the class .py files or whatever i guess?

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:42pm UTC+10
ive not been able to find much code on it

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:42pm UTC+10
Yeap

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:42pm UTC+10
do you have any examples you can show me?

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:42pm UTC+10
ok cool

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:42pm UTC+10
Yeap

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:42pm UTC+10
i would check hover with rect.collidepoint right?

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:42pm UTC+10
So a .color property and a .is_hovering

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:42pm UTC+10
Make stuff light up on hover

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:41pm UTC+10
height

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:41pm UTC+10
width

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:41pm UTC+10
click()

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:41pm UTC+10
so what methods and properties would i have in a buttons class?

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:41pm UTC+10
like director/scene stuff

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:41pm UTC+10
ive got a level manager/scene manager thing

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:41pm UTC+10
Good

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:40pm UTC+10
i am

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:40pm UTC+10
*classes

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:40pm UTC+10
Make everything classeds

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:40pm UTC+10
But um make button classes

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:40pm UTC+10
So that all I need to do to resize it is change one thing

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:40pm UTC+10
and I base every dimension off the tile width and height

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
Well pretty much everything I've done has been using tiles with a set width and height

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
dynamic margins but fixed widths?

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
so like how i would do it in css?

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
with like 3 buttons

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
Nah

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
honestly just a main menu

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
percentage based?

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
I don't know what you're trying to build

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:38pm UTC+10
Make everything dynamic and based off a basic width/height

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:38pm UTC+10
any tips on making a menu?

Luke TuthillSunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:38pm UTC+10
All the time

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 28, 2015 at 5:38pm UTC+10

Claudio LuciniSaturday, June 27, 2015 at 10:04am UTC+10

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 14, 2015 at 11:53am UTC+10

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 14, 2015 at 11:53am UTC+10

a speed buff

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 14, 2015 at 11:53am UTC+10
the wormhole one is kind of useful

Luke TuthillSunday, June 14, 2015 at 11:47am UTC+10
Versus 0/3 Nova augments

Luke TuthillSunday, June 14, 2015 at 11:47am UTC+10
Ok so 2/3 banshee augments are good

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 14, 2015 at 11:45am UTC+10

Luke TuthillSunday, June 14, 2015 at 11:43am UTC+10

Luke TuthillSunday, June 14, 2015 at 11:41am UTC+10

Luke TuthillSunday, June 14, 2015 at 11:41am UTC+10
No

Luke TuthillSunday, June 14, 2015 at 11:41am UTC+10
Were we talking about Primes?

Luke TuthillSunday, June 14, 2015 at 11:41am UTC+10
You could kill Nova with the Pangolin Sowrd

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 14, 2015 at 11:40am UTC+10

Or you can just hit Nova with any weapon and she'll shatter

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 14, 2015 at 11:40am UTC+10
m prime 2x damage no matter where you hit

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 14, 2015 at 11:40am UTC+10

Luke TuthillSunday, June 14, 2015 at 11:39am UTC+10
Um

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 14, 2015 at 11:39am UTC+10
and costs lots of energy

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 14, 2015 at 11:39am UTC+10
and banshee has a constant energy drain and can't shoot stuff in the process

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 14, 2015 at 11:38am UTC+10

Luke TuthillSunday, June 14, 2015 at 9:42am UTC+10
Best Answer: Clear only works from a terminal. You're not running in a terminal, you're running in an IDE so the terminal-specific behavior won't work.

Luke TuthillSunday, June 14, 2015 at 9:42am UTC+10
See if it's the OS module in general

Luke TuthillSunday, June 14, 2015 at 9:42am UTC+10
Try using os.system('echo "smth"')

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 14, 2015 at 9:41am UTC+10
but its outputting in a tab inside the editor

Jacob SalwaySunday, June 14, 2015 at 9:41am UTC+10
its using system python compiling

Tom WilliamsFriday, July 3, 2015 at 8:29pm UTC+10
But the politicians pay the media

Chris HowdenFriday, July 3, 2015 at 8:27pm UTC+10
Very true

Tom WilliamsFriday, July 3, 2015 at 8:27pm UTC+10
I said most, ones I know, and I never said politicians

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 8:27pm UTC+10
This is how all politicians work

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 8:27pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 6:03pm UTC+10
Ben BurnsFriday, July 3, 2015 at 6:02pm UTC+10
Nah nah nah you need ads for that authentic Internet feel. May as well be an interesting ad

Tom WilliamsFriday, July 3, 2015 at 6:01pm UTC+10
Or, you know, just get an actual ad blocker

Ben BurnsFriday, July 3, 2015 at 6:00pm UTC+10
Worth

Tom WilliamsFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:57pm UTC+10
So people who don't know what adblock is would probably not even want to get rid of it

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:57pm UTC+10
That's actually cool

Tom WilliamsFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:57pm UTC+10
Except it puts one ad at the top of every page

Tom WilliamsFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:57pm UTC+10
It functions as an ad blocker

Tom WilliamsFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:56pm UTC+10
So I found an adware I actually like. Well I obviously removed it but still

You still have to fix the chess board.

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:19pm UTC+10
That was fun

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:19pm UTC+10
And fixed bishop

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:17pm UTC+10
Ok fixed rook

Zac FrancisWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:15pm UTC+10

Travis ValentiWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:15pm UTC+10
Yes

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:15pm UTC+10
I think that somewhere my algorithm is sorta dead

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:15pm UTC+10
That was my mouse, there's a hover effect on the tiles

Shut up travis

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:13pm UTC+10
Knight:

Travis ValentiWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:13pm UTC+10
A chess board is 8x8 not 10x10

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:12pm UTC+10
That one's fine

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:12pm UTC+10

Travis ValentiWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:12pm UTC+10
I'm very disappointed in you luke

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:12pm UTC+10
Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:10pm UTC+10
Here are some examples of what the game thinks pieces should be able to do:

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:09pm UTC+10
And I was trying to highlight possible moves for a piece

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:09pm UTC+10
So it has chess aspects

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:09pm UTC+10
Trying to get a thing fo the SDD game working

It is enchanted with dark magic

Travis ValentiWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:02pm UTC+10

Travis ValentiWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 8:02pm UTC+10

Zac FrancisWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 6:21pm UTC+10
yes

Craig SmithWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 6:21pm UTC+10
oh

Zac FrancisWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 6:21pm UTC+10
something entirely different I believe

Chris HowdenWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 6:20pm UTC+10
what was it

Zac FrancisWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 6:19pm UTC+10
ty friends

Craig SmithWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 6:19pm UTC+10
hmm?

Zac FrancisWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 6:19pm UTC+10
I think I might have found the problem

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 6:17pm UTC+10
And then hit alt enter and Pycharm should fix it

Craig SmithWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 6:16pm UTC+10
eek

Zac FrancisWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 6:16pm UTC+10
Hmm

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 6:14pm UTC+10
Separate it into different ifs

Chris HowdenWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 6:13pm UTC+10
If its broken you can see it clearly and or fix easily

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 6:13pm UTC+10
What you could do

Chris HowdenWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 6:13pm UTC+10
This is why I prefer hardware

Hug a pillow and forget it exists

Zac FrancisWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 6:09pm UTC+10
it's killing me and I don't know how to fix it

Zac FrancisWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 6:06pm UTC+10
luke the trouble is with a and b and not c or d is that it think it has to have a and b true and then b false or d positive

Zac FrancisWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:47pm UTC+10
that all works perfectly except in my code and it makes me cry so much

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:45pm UTC+10
Btw you can just say print((a and b and not c) or d)

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:43pm UTC+10
Set 1,2,3 to false and 4 to true and see if it returns reue

Zac FrancisWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:43pm UTC+10
targeting is True right before the statement, it just isn't accepting it and running the program

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:43pm UTC+10
And try the statement

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:43pm UTC+10
Set var a, b, and c

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:42pm UTC+10
Open a terminal

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:42pm UTC+10
Well debug it

Zac FrancisWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:42pm UTC+10
doesn't work travis

Zac FrancisWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:41pm UTC+10
but it's not working :(

Zac FrancisWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:41pm UTC+10
I want if (var1 and var2 and not var3) or var4: do some stuff

Zac FrancisWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:40pm UTC+10
so i have if var1 and var2 and not var3: do some stuff

Zac FrancisWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
I want the targeting variable separate from the rest so if it is True it will work regardless of the rest

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
Say it in pseudo

Travis ValentiWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
Try == True

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
What do you want to do?

Zac FrancisWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:38pm UTC+10
but it doesn't seem to be accepting it

Zac FrancisWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:38pm UTC+10
I want to have elif ((collision_detect(selector_pos[1]) and pygame.mouse.get_pressed()[0]) and not mouse_clicked) or targeting:

Zac FrancisWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 5:37pm UTC+10
so I have elif (collision_detect(selector_pos[1]) and pygame.mouse.get_pressed()[0]) and not mouse_clicked:

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 4:10pm UTC+10
If I were actually bothered I would say that it was creepy

Kai WebberSunday, April 19, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
Had it been summer we probably could go to the beach

Luke TuthillSunday, April 19, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
Some might want to go into the water, some might want to play cricket or footy

Luke TuthillSunday, April 19, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
But we'd split off into separate groups

Cameron DoddSunday, April 19, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
True

Luke TuthillSunday, April 19, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
We'd all be at the beach

Luke TuthillSunday, April 19, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
Like

Luke TuthillSunday, April 19, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
I feel that it wouldn't be doing something together as a class though

Conor SchullSunday, April 19, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
sarcasm was intended before but it didn't work out

Cameron DoddSunday, April 19, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10

Kai WebberSunday, April 19, 2015 at 8:55pm UTC+10

Kai WebberSunday, April 19, 2015 at 8:54pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSunday, April 19, 2015 at 8:43pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, April 15, 2015 at 8:46pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, April 15, 2015 at 8:46pm UTC+10
It says you're in Paris

Freya LawlessWednesday, April 15, 2015 at 8:46pm UTC+10

Freya LawlessWednesday, April 15, 2015 at 8:45pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, April 15, 2015 at 8:37pm UTC+10
Snobbishness cross the need of privacy

Luke TuthillWednesday, April 15, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
Because I've avoided it for so long

Freya LawlessWednesday, April 15, 2015 at 8:34pm UTC+10
haha why

Luke TuthillWednesday, April 15, 2015 at 8:33pm UTC+10

Hannah SpinksWednesday, April 15, 2015 at 8:12pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, April 15, 2015 at 8:12pm UTC+10
I though you were someone else briefly

Luke TuthillWednesday, April 15, 2015 at 8:11pm UTC+10
Haha

Hannah SpinksWednesday, April 15, 2015 at 8:11pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, April 15, 2015 at 8:09pm UTC+10
Heya

Lucy Chen, Luke Tuthill
Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 2:01pm UTC+10
:-P

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:59pm UTC+10
Um...yeah...

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:59pm UTC+10
But thats different

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:59pm UTC+10
Except Satanism

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:59pm UTC+10
Yeah definitely

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:57pm UTC+10
I mean...no religion promotes "bad" things, it's when people interpret them wrong when it gets bad

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:56pm UTC+10
Mm

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:56pm UTC+10
Well more like just make it optional

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:56pm UTC+10
Should religion play a part in Scouts at all

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:55pm UTC+10
If you ask them to let us vote on it like statewide

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:54pm UTC+10
Yeah okay :-)

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:54pm UTC+10
I'll tell you how it goes after I call them on Monday

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:53pm UTC+10
No problem 󾌰

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:53pm UTC+10
Thanks for your support ☺

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:52pm UTC+10
But I agree with you all the way

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:52pm UTC+10
I'm not really the one to ask about this stuff

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:51pm UTC+10
In the scout promise

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:51pm UTC+10
It kinda says that we have to have a religion

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:49pm UTC+10
It would say in the book

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:48pm UTC+10
I feel like they would have told us if we had to be religious

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:48pm UTC+10
Yeah

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:48pm UTC+10
Say*

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:48pm UTC+10
I also want to check what my records day

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:48pm UTC+10
I dunno about going anonymously

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:48pm UTC+10
Hmm

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:47pm UTC+10
Just in case

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:47pm UTC+10
Anonymously

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:47pm UTC+10
On Monday

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:47pm UTC+10
Before you do anything

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:47pm UTC+10
I will

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:47pm UTC+10
I would contact the state commissioner

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:47pm UTC+10
No that's good

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:46pm UTC+10
I may be a bit ambitious but...

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:46pm UTC+10
Then would I be able to get enough support to change the rules

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:46pm UTC+10
Well if it's not just me

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:45pm UTC+10
Not just to you

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:45pm UTC+10
That is just so...wrong (to me, morally speaking)

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:44pm UTC+10
Well do that then

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:44pm UTC+10
Well my leaders just told me to pick one and go with it

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:44pm UTC+10
Talk to your leaders about it I think is your best option

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:44pm UTC+10
Did they put down a religion

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:44pm UTC+10
You will be fine

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:43pm UTC+10
I know people who have their QSA who aren't religious

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:43pm UTC+10
Rules and regulations and all that outdated stuff

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:43pm UTC+10
I believe they can, despite the injustice of it

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:42pm UTC+10
They can't reject a proposal on the grounds that the person doesn't believe that there's a god

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:41pm UTC+10
We must accept there is a God

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:41pm UTC+10
It doesn't specifically say that you have ti be religious

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:41pm UTC+10
But that's vague and misleading

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:41pm UTC+10
Yeah...

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:40pm UTC+10
Clarification of Religious Policy for Venturer Scouts The Venturer Scout Section is no different from any other Section with regard to the Association’s Religious Policy; ie, all members are to abide by the Scout Promise, which accepts that there is a God. Potential Queen’s Scouts must be prepared to accept the Association’s Religious Policy to be a Queen’s Scout. If the Venturer Scout does not, he/she cannot be a Queen’s Scout.

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:40pm UTC+10
Here's the section of the QSA policy which addresses it:

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:40pm UTC+10
I've done my ideals

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:39pm UTC+10
In your ideals badge there are options that aren't religious

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:39pm UTC+10
That's what I'm planning to do

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:39pm UTC+10
You can complain to them it's not right

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:37pm UTC+10
If it says so in the book...if it says so in the official stuff...what can I do if my application is rejected (in the future)

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:33pm UTC+10
Yeah...I dunno man...

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:33pm UTC+10
Also that's just wrong and it goes against the core values of scouting

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:33pm UTC+10
Mum's a leader and she said that that's not allowed

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:32pm UTC+10
I need to have something written in my book for my religion

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:31pm UTC+10
I wouldn't worry about it

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:31pm UTC+10
And even if it is how are they going to know

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:31pm UTC+10
But they can't do that that's not allowed Barold must have misinterpreted it

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:30pm UTC+10
Haha don't worry

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:30pm UTC+10
What

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:30pm UTC+10
Barold I mean

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:30pm UTC+10
Everyone LOVES Barry

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:30pm UTC+10
Ahh barry

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:29pm UTC+10
Like at all

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:29pm UTC+10
That can't be right

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:29pm UTC+10
Yeah according to Barry Kilby who said he was specifically told

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:28pm UTC+10
WHAT

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:28pm UTC+10
Well I want to get my Queen's scout but apparently the state commissioner has specified that agnostic/atheist/non religion will automatically mean that the applicant will fail

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 1:06pm UTC+10
Yeah go on :-)

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:58pm UTC+10
Would you still like me to continue

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:58pm UTC+10
Mm

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:58pm UTC+10
Oh ok

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:58pm UTC+10
The guides have removed religion from their promise, the UK have removed religion as a requirement to be a scout

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:58pm UTC+10
WiFi is about to briefly disappear

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:57pm UTC+10
Yeah same

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:57pm UTC+10
Honestly, I find it a little....stupid

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:57pm UTC+10
yeah?

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:57pm UTC+10
I've never been to a Buddhist temple or anything I just like what they do

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:56pm UTC+10
And how we must have a religion

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:56pm UTC+10
I'm just thinking about scouting in general

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:56pm UTC+10
Hmmm

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:55pm UTC+10
I don't believe in any higher power

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:55pm UTC+10
It's not religious

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:54pm UTC+10
then you do have a religious belief (kinda)

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:54pm UTC+10
Well I'm self declared Buddhist but that's not exactly religious

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:53pm UTC+10
just clarifying: you don't have any religious beliefs whatsoever?

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:53pm UTC+10
well

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:53pm UTC+10
yeah

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:53pm UTC+10
Accepting though

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:52pm UTC+10
nope

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:52pm UTC+10
Nope are you

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:52pm UTC+10
random question: are you religious?

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 12:52pm UTC+10
Hello 󾌵

Lucy ChenSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 11:02am UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:58pm UTC+10
Ok :)

Lucy ChenThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:58pm UTC+10
My phone is on 9% btw so I may disappear for a bit

Lucy ChenThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:57pm UTC+10
Haha I just don't really like slopes/going uphill in general :P

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:57pm UTC+10
??

Lucy ChenThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:57pm UTC+10
I was dying but all good now

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:56pm UTC+10
How was it?

Lucy ChenThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:56pm UTC+10
On my way back home

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:55pm UTC+10
How're you going?

Lucy ChenThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:55pm UTC+10
Cute

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:55pm UTC+10
And she was on tiptoe and awww :3

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:55pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:55pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:54pm UTC+10
Like

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:54pm UTC+10
And it was picturesque

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:54pm UTC+10
First kiss that meant anything

Lucy ChenThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:54pm UTC+10
Haha nice! That's good to know

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:53pm UTC+10
And she is... wonderful I can't even express

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:53pm UTC+10
And with someone else

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:52pm UTC+10
Well they're all solved now because I'm not with my previous girlfriend

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:52pm UTC+10
Probably not

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:52pm UTC+10
Did I ever tell you about relationship problems?

Lucy ChenThursday, July 2, 2015 at 3:52pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 9:06pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
Hmmmm

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
Well unless I will be conversing with intelligent people I don't need it

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 9:04pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:06pm UTC+10
It is by far one of the most gorgeous things I've ever seen

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:06pm UTC+10
Oh my god. We are driving and the sky is crystal clear and filled with stars, but around the horizon there is a thick layer of clouds and... lighting

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:04pm UTC+10
mm okay

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:04pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:04pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:03pm UTC+10
Sooooo

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:03pm UTC+10
Oh okay :P

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:03pm UTC+10
What? no she doesn't really understand what you've been through in terms of love

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:03pm UTC+10
And she looked away at a wall and I couldn't help but laugh

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:02pm UTC+10
You are just jealous

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:02pm UTC+10
I feel like she doesn't really understand :(

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:02pm UTC+10
And I was like

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:02pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:02pm UTC+10
Hmm that could be interesting if our parents meet which they're probably going to have to if this is going to happen

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:01pm UTC+10
And I quickly and quietly said 'well not anymore we are not'

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:01pm UTC+10
And she started complaining that I so violently insisted that we were just friends

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:00pm UTC+10
<3

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:00pm UTC+10
And I said that I really want to watch it with you

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 8:00pm UTC+10
And she complained about how we have star wars at home

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 7:59pm UTC+10
Well asked her about the marathon

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 7:59pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 7:58pm UTC+10
My mom gets so irritated that I actually date people at this age She was one of the quiet girls in the background that was terrified to talk to a guy

Ah well I guess it wouldn't be as romantic

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 6:40pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 6:40pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 6:39pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 6:33pm UTC+10
What doesn't she like about it?

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 6:32pm UTC+10
Possibly

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 6:32pm UTC+10
So

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 6:32pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 6:32pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 6:31pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:47pm UTC+10
I'm looking forward to this star wars marathon more and more

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:46pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:45pm UTC+10
Hmm Not too unlikely

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:44pm UTC+10
Mutual handjob :P

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:44pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:43pm UTC+10
And a little more :P

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:43pm UTC+10
And we were pressing into each other and making out

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:43pm UTC+10
We were in the back seat of my car going somewhere I don't know where

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:42pm UTC+10
I had another dream last night

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:40pm UTC+10
So let's do both

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:40pm UTC+10
Holding is better though

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
I really need to kiss you right now

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
I really need to hold you right now

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
More than a little

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
Okay

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
I was a little overcome by emotion just then

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:38pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:38pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:37pm UTC+10
I love you

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:37pm UTC+10
I don't need to wish for that because I know, whenever it is in my power, I won't let you go. You've done so much for me. You are the reason I'm breathing.

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:35pm UTC+10
If there is one thing I wish for it would be that we could be together for ever and ever

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:34pm UTC+10
If there is one thing I wish for it is to be able to let you see yourself through my eyes

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:33pm UTC+10
And spectacular

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:33pm UTC+10
You are wrong

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:33pm UTC+10
And how beautiful and perfect and adorable

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:33pm UTC+10
Not underestimating anything here you're much more important because of how amazing you are

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:32pm UTC+10
You greatly underestimate your importance. And it is my responsibility to get you to realise that.

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:30pm UTC+10
and to love me

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:30pm UTC+10
For everything you've done to help me

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:30pm UTC+10
I love you more

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:30pm UTC+10
I love you <3

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:29pm UTC+10
How was I blessed with you

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:29pm UTC+10
In mind, body and soul

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:29pm UTC+10
You are so beautiful, Anastasia

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:29pm UTC+10
<3

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:29pm UTC+10
Well then with that piece of information you are now the dominant person in this relationship

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:28pm UTC+10
Also that puts me in the leading position, which should help you with your fear of crossing lines

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:27pm UTC+10
I do enjoy it Even though I don't always admit it

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:27pm UTC+10
Well you may not be the dominant one but you are the limiting reageant :P

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:26pm UTC+10
Haha

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:26pm UTC+10
Well since we are both submissive someone has to do it now and again :P

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:25pm UTC+10
You say you're not the dominant one in this relationship?

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:25pm UTC+10
It's funny

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:23pm UTC+10
More time to wait before sex :(

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:23pm UTC+10
Crap

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:23pm UTC+10
oh no

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:23pm UTC+10
Teasing One of the weapons against you that I can use

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:22pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:22pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:22pm UTC+10
What do you mean here you go

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:20pm UTC+10
Tickle torture if done well for a shortish period of time is good

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:20pm UTC+10
Well Here you go :)

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:20pm UTC+10
Like I do want to get to sex eventually xD

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:20pm UTC+10
up to a point

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:20pm UTC+10
I don't know

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:19pm UTC+10
Either the same thing Or Is someone here not a big fan of teasing?

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:19pm UTC+10
:P

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:19pm UTC+10
What would you do to me

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:19pm UTC+10
What type of payback

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:19pm UTC+10
Payyyyback :P

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:18pm UTC+10
She was enjoying herself

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:18pm UTC+10
And if it were me?

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:18pm UTC+10
:P

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:18pm UTC+10
Also being in her place... I'd probably beat the guy up after he let me go 😂

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:16pm UTC+10
Haha

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:16pm UTC+10
I was sitting next to my parents a few seconds before I opened the link

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:15pm UTC+10
Well there was no nudity in that was there?

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:15pm UTC+10
Possibly slightly NSFW? I'm scared to find out what you find completely NSFW :P

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:14pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:14pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:04pm UTC+10
Being in a car wash is the weirdest thing

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:02pm UTC+10
Adooooorable

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:02pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 5:00pm UTC+10

I love you

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:56pm UTC+10
Oh you don't need to sneak into my house to help me with self consciousness

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:56pm UTC+10
And then cuddle you cause I wouldn't be able to resist

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:56pm UTC+10
Bad turtle I will sneak into your house and steal your self - consciousness

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:55pm UTC+10
Hmm you're in a pretty good position I wish I could say the same about myself every day <3

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:54pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:54pm UTC+10
Idk I just looked in the mirror and went

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:53pm UTC+10
Why do you have high self esteem? :P

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:53pm UTC+10
Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:53pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:53pm UTC+10
Whoops xD

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:53pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:52pm UTC+10
And were completely unrelated

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:52pm UTC+10
Well the two messages were sent like an hour and a half apart

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:52pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:52pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:50pm UTC+10
Haha well that's one way to interpret it :P

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:12pm UTC+10
You just got two cushions for you bed and now you have high self-esteem?

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:11pm UTC+10
Hey sweetie <3

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 12:28pm UTC+10
I just got 2 cushions for my bed :D

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 10:12am UTC+10
I am suffering from a severe case of high self - esteem

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 10:12am UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:49pm UTC+10
Well I'm off to sleep Goodnight xx I love you

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 7:01pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 7:00pm UTC+10
Now I just watched Amy and the Doctor make out I got a little jealous

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 6:35pm UTC+10
You are making it very hard to breathe normally

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 6:16pm UTC+10
Trace my fingers down your spine?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:57pm UTC+10
Hey :)

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:48pm UTC+10
Aw :)

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:48pm UTC+10
It's because of how sweet you are <3

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:48pm UTC+10
That's not where I got it from

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:48pm UTC+10
Haha yeah xD

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:47pm UTC+10
River Song?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:47pm UTC+10
Sweetie

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:47pm UTC+10
I just remembered

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:41pm UTC+10
03:16:38:40

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:40pm UTC+10
I need you too Just a few more days

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:31pm UTC+10
I need your arms around me

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:31pm UTC+10
I need you to be with me

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:31pm UTC+10
I need you, Anastasia

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:31pm UTC+10

You do look beautiful in a dress

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:26pm UTC+10
Hm?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:24pm UTC+10
well

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:24pm UTC+10
Too cold

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:24pm UTC+10
Ah ok

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:24pm UTC+10
Probably leggings and a sweater

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:23pm UTC+10
Going to wear a dress?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:22pm UTC+10
:(

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:22pm UTC+10
Ugh I have to look good and be polite and ugh

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:22pm UTC+10
Ooo

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:21pm UTC+10
Saran Thai at Gosford With a bunch of family friends

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 5:21pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 4:33pm UTC+10
<3

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 4:10pm UTC+10
I love you too Possibly too much for my own good

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 4:09pm UTC+10
God I love you, Anastasia

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 4:09pm UTC+10
If you were there I would be okay

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 4:07pm UTC+10
Yeah it is pretty jump-scarey

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 4:07pm UTC+10
The paranoia is too bad

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 4:07pm UTC+10
Nope nope nope nope

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 4:07pm UTC+10
:P

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 4:07pm UTC+10
I noped out 5 minutes in

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 4:06pm UTC+10
How are you going

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:45pm UTC+10
:P have fun

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:45pm UTC+10
I might play amnesia actually

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:28pm UTC+10
I can understand why that's hilarious

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:28pm UTC+10
Mom ran into the room and told me that before breaking down in hysteria

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:27pm UTC+10
Haha WAT

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:27pm UTC+10
On a completely different note, if you read the Russian word for toilet backwards it spells out I will pull you in

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:11pm UTC+10
My love for you is the truest I've ever had

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:11pm UTC+10
I love you I really do

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:09pm UTC+10
this is the logical part of me

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:09pm UTC+10
Please, Anastasia

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:09pm UTC+10
Don't you dare you have nothing to be sorry for

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:09pm UTC+10
I'm going to talk to him and apologise Also sorry I brought it up. Kinda ruined your mood

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:04pm UTC+10
Because you loved him

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:03pm UTC+10
I rushed into it Something I've done before. Multiple times. Hopefully, this time I'll learn

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:02pm UTC+10
It wasn't a concious decision

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:01pm UTC+10
You put him under the illusion because you were in love with him

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:01pm UTC+10
I shouldn't have lied

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:01pm UTC+10
He should have realised

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 3:00pm UTC+10
Nothing is his fault And it's not me just taking the blame cause it's easier. I put him under the illusion that I belonged to him and him only. But it was a lie. I was never his, and it took him 3 months to realise that

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:58pm UTC+10
It's his fault for staying with you even though he wasn't in an equal relationship

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:55pm UTC+10
I knew perfectly well that I was leaning the wrong way. I was not ready to make the full commitment. And the night after Friday I was dying inside because I have seen what I can do and god forbid I hurt you like that.

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:53pm UTC+10
You didn't know he was going to want so much of you

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:53pm UTC+10
I sould have never said yes to him in the first place. He would have come out with less pain than he did. I could have prevented it.

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:52pm UTC+10
In the right

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:52pm UTC+10
Are

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:52pm UTC+10
You

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:52pm UTC+10
He wanted more than you wanted to give

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:51pm UTC+10
He had to do it. He had to break it off. He was the one that was right. He put the candle down even though he needed the light so much.

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:50pm UTC+10
Did I really care about him enough to step right out of my comfort zone to satisfy him?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:50pm UTC+10
I quote

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:50pm UTC+10
But in breaking up with him you were in the right

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:50pm UTC+10
That was the moment I turned around and saw the whole situation. For the first time. That was why I was insecure about my answer. I did not want to hurt another person so much ever again

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:48pm UTC+10
I hurt Matt A lot When he broke up with me he said, and I quote: I am sorry. I just feel like I'm the only person on this planet that wants this relationship. I am so sorry. I still love you.

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:47pm UTC+10
You weren't hurting a single person

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:46pm UTC+10
What do you mean

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:46pm UTC+10
I made the choice to turn away and ignore the fact that I was hurting people, while trying to be happy

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:46pm UTC+10
No I should have seen

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:45pm UTC+10
Don't be Part of it is my fault too

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:44pm UTC+10
I am so sorry, Anastasia

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:44pm UTC+10
Oh my god

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:44pm UTC+10
And I put so much soul into you that I did not realise that I, myself, was melting too

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:42pm UTC+10
And I felt completely useless, not certain whether you want my light, and not being able to scream at you to put the melting candle down

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:40pm UTC+10
Thank you

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:40pm UTC+10
That is a beautiful analogy, Anastasia

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:40pm UTC+10
I guess it's like holding a candle and having the melted wax drip on your fingers, burning you but not giving much light And it's your choice whether to put the candle down or try convince yourself that the light is enough

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:38pm UTC+10
That part is my fault

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:38pm UTC+10
No you're wrong

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:38pm UTC+10
For staying with her even though I wasn't in an equal relationship

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:38pm UTC+10
NOTHING IS YOUR FAULT

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:38pm UTC+10
It's partly my fault

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:37pm UTC+10
I don't know

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:37pm UTC+10
I hold nothing against her, but sometimes (I tell myself it's just jealousy) I feel like she did not deserve you if she was gonna keep you around, not returning your feelings with the same intensity

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:35pm UTC+10
Or aleesha

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:35pm UTC+10
wait me think about it in context of you

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:35pm UTC+10
Yeah

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:35pm UTC+10
And I want you to think about that

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:35pm UTC+10
But honestly I ask myself this a lot, looking back at it, Did I really care about him enough to step right out of my comfort zone to satisfy him?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:33pm UTC+10
Yeah that's what she felt

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:32pm UTC+10
Yeah But when I think about it, I'd rather not be with Matt than not be able to provide him with the relationship that he wants

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:32pm UTC+10
You and aleesha are in the same boat?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:31pm UTC+10
Somehow I feel that we are in the same boat I felt the same And I didn't expect the surge of negativity I got when Matt dumped me

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:30pm UTC+10
But I was just generally frustrated that I couldn't make everyone happy

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:30pm UTC+10
And she didn't want me to

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:29pm UTC+10
And I was of course not going to leave you

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:29pm UTC+10
And she told me that she hadn't thought she would feel this way

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:29pm UTC+10
She was rather brusque and impersonal

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:29pm UTC+10
So I started talking to her

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:29pm UTC+10
But apparently (and I actually only knew about this because her sister told me) she didn't seem ok with it

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:28pm UTC+10
And I thought everything was good

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:28pm UTC+10
Thank god

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:28pm UTC+10
I obviously took her advice

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:28pm UTC+10
That I should be with you because she wasn't ready for the relationship I wanted

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:27pm UTC+10
She told me on like monday of the last week

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:27pm UTC+10
Basically

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:27pm UTC+10
I know

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:27pm UTC+10
You can tell me But only if you want to

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:26pm UTC+10
A couple of days ago I was a bit frustrated

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:26pm UTC+10
I'm okay now I think

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:26pm UTC+10
Are you okay?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:26pm UTC+10
With Aleesha

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:26pm UTC+10
With you it's all good, but

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:26pm UTC+10
Good emotion and bad emotion

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:26pm UTC+10
Emotion increases with absence

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:25pm UTC+10
It's funny

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:25pm UTC+10
I will always need you

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:25pm UTC+10
When I don't have things to do to distract myself, I realise just how bad I need you

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:23pm UTC+10
Oh god <3

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:23pm UTC+10
Deep Pun intended

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:22pm UTC+10
If there were no restrictions then there would be... no restrictions?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:22pm UTC+10
Well sex is good

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:22pm UTC+10
True though

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:22pm UTC+10
That's not a very creative answer :P

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:21pm UTC+10
*then

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:21pm UTC+10
Well than whatever you wanted me to do

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:20pm UTC+10
Like if I was fine with anything

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:20pm UTC+10
What do you mean no restrictions

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:20pm UTC+10
If there were no restrictions, what would you do to me?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:17pm UTC+10
Well then ;)

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:17pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:09pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:09pm UTC+10
I really want to see you play the piano Seeing your hands run over the keys is just *sigh*

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:05pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 2:05pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:56pm UTC+10
Waiting for someone to do it for you :P

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:56pm UTC+10
Why haven't you tried it then :P

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:55pm UTC+10
Somewhat

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:55pm UTC+10
Do you know where it is?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:55pm UTC+10
Never tried

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:55pm UTC+10
Does it work?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:55pm UTC+10
Have you utilised the g spot before?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:55pm UTC+10
:P mhm

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:55pm UTC+10
Tbh if it wasn't for the internet I don't know where I'd be 😝

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:54pm UTC+10
Thank you internet

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:54pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:54pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:54pm UTC+10
Also I now know where the g spot is

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:53pm UTC+10
:P I will happily return the favour and apparently it's one of the most pleasurable things you can do

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:53pm UTC+10
Hmm :P

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:52pm UTC+10
I was originally referring to kissing but I couldn't resist :P

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:51pm UTC+10
;)

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:51pm UTC+10
It matters in other things though but they don't involve your hands

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:48pm UTC+10
trust me warmth doesn't matter

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:46pm UTC+10
They warm up anyway

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:46pm UTC+10
Yeah

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:45pm UTC+10
Reallllllllllyyyy?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:45pm UTC+10
No it does

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:45pm UTC+10
In terms of beating Dani ;)

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:44pm UTC+10
?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:44pm UTC+10
It wouldn't feel all that great

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:44pm UTC+10
Not getting the context sorry

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:43pm UTC+10
No just cold

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:43pm UTC+10
Cold as in wet?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:43pm UTC+10
Also take that in the context of the above conversation

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:42pm UTC+10
aw :(

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:41pm UTC+10
Observation: My hands are really cold

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:38pm UTC+10
Ok :) Don't rush it

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:38pm UTC+10
Not yet I probably will this evening

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:38pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:32pm UTC+10
3:20:47:18

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:32pm UTC+10
This waiting is literally killing me

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:30pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:30pm UTC+10
Mm thought so

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:30pm UTC+10
Probably the marathon

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:30pm UTC+10
Tuesday or Star Wars Marathon

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:30pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:29pm UTC+10
It will by itself At some point

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:29pm UTC+10
How would I make said situation occur?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:29pm UTC+10
The right situation :P

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:28pm UTC+10
;) what would that require

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:28pm UTC+10
Hmm Maybe.... ;)

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:26pm UTC+10
;)

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:26pm UTC+10
We could go for a one-up on Dani

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:23pm UTC+10
The more intimate the better

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:23pm UTC+10
Anything

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:23pm UTC+10
I don't know

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:06pm UTC+10
What do you want me to do to you?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:04pm UTC+10
Lightly run my fingers across your neck, playing with your hair

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:03pm UTC+10
I really want to let my self control go for a little bit Run my hands along your back, neck and shoulders

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:02pm UTC+10
I need you

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 1:02pm UTC+10

I want to...

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 11:13am UTC+10
I am very stubborn And unless you feel like travelling miles and miles right now you might have to go a little bit longer without my touch

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 11:12am UTC+10
You could just succumb to it

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 11:12am UTC+10
No you don't

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 11:12am UTC+10
Well I might have to teach you a lesson on it, huh?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 11:11am UTC+10
I have no patience

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 11:11am UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 11:08am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 11:07am UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 11:03am UTC+10
I mean if I were to adopt I would do it

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 11:02am UTC+10
Like months of preparation

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 11:02am UTC+10
Apparently it's not worth the effort though

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 11:02am UTC+10
Probably

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 11:01am UTC+10
http://www.wikihow.com/Lactate#Understanding_Induced_Lactation_sub

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 11:00am UTC+10
Can't you force it? by kneading and eating certain foods

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 11:00am UTC+10
Whoa okay

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 11:00am UTC+10
Apparently when you are in the shower the hot water relaxes you so much that it happens

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:59am UTC+10
Yeah

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:58am UTC+10
So you wouldn't have done it before

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:57am UTC+10
It's only when you're pregnant isn't it

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:57am UTC+10
xD

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:57am UTC+10
How, when, details

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:56am UTC+10
What's the deal with lactation?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:56am UTC+10
Ok

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:56am UTC+10
Idk just random question popped up in my head

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:56am UTC+10
Why xD

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:47am UTC+10
Okay Thanks

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:46am UTC+10
And you can also sit down

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:46am UTC+10
Which makes it less visible

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:46am UTC+10
But you can tuck the tip under the tight bit of your underpants

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:45am UTC+10
And I don't normally wear loose pantts

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:45am UTC+10
It depends on what pants you're wearing, loose pants = more visible

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:44am UTC+10
Well they're not normally visible

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:44am UTC+10
Or...

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:44am UTC+10
Do you just kinda wait

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:44am UTC+10
Random question, How do you deal with a boner in public?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:40am UTC+10
Heya :D

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:40am UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:40am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 10:28am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:50am UTC+10
Congrats

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:50am UTC+10
Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:48am UTC+10
Not really, I gave great self-control

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:48am UTC+10
Well that's good :)

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:48am UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:46am UTC+10
That's not unexpected

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:46am UTC+10
Maybe more than one

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:45am UTC+10
I can't deny that I may have had fun whilst talking to you at at least one point in the past

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:45am UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:37am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:37am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:36am UTC+10
Looking into your eyes

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:36am UTC+10
Pressing into each other

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:36am UTC+10
Hmm I haven't tried it all that much But probably

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:35am UTC+10
Do you like grinding? I think you do

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:32am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:32am UTC+10
We can take turns

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:32am UTC+10
You know what

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:32am UTC+10
But then again it's about you not me

Inherited something, havent we?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:29am UTC+10
*neck

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:29am UTC+10
So? It's not the most sensitive, you have access to my back

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:28am UTC+10
Hey but then I don't have acess to your back

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:28am UTC+10
*my

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:28am UTC+10
Your breasts pushing into me chest and our legs intertwined

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:27am UTC+10
I want to feel you pressing down on me

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:27am UTC+10
Nope xD

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:26am UTC+10
That argument will never be resolved 😂

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:26am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:24am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:23am UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:23am UTC+10
And your face was outlined against the stars

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:22am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:21am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:16am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:16am UTC+10
Hmm ok

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:15am UTC+10
It's okay, they'll probably insist on driving me

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:15am UTC+10
Well we can meet you at woy woy if needs be

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:14am UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:14am UTC+10
Distance wise mostly

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:13am UTC+10
Like distance wise or you'll get raped wise

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:13am UTC+10
Haha I was sorta joking but sorta not

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:12am UTC+10
Oh like bogans

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:12am UTC+10
Cause it's the central coast?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:11am UTC+10
What are the reasons that they might not let you

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:11am UTC+10
Well ok

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:11am UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:11am UTC+10
Close friendship

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:10am UTC+10
Like close to sex or that we have a close friendship or that we're physically close

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:09am UTC+10
Like me and Marina - close

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:09am UTC+10
Sorry? Close in what way

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:09am UTC+10
Well my parents know that we were pretty fucking close So in terms of safety they should be okay

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:07am UTC+10
I don't know on one hand there's just friends = no sex but on the other there's in love = trust and safety

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:07am UTC+10
What do you think?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:06am UTC+10
Mm ok

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:06am UTC+10
But Idk

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:06am UTC+10
It'll be easier if they think we're friends

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:05am UTC+10
But the question is will telling them before asking about the marathon help or hinder

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:05am UTC+10
Yeah me neither

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:04am UTC+10
But we don't have this "connection" where I will excitedly run home and start talking about my life

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:03am UTC+10
I never tell them anything Like I do after a month or so

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:03am UTC+10
Why?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:03am UTC+10
Which makes is easier actually

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:02am UTC+10
Nope

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:02am UTC+10
Do they know about us?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:02am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:02am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:02am UTC+10
Just if you do ask them don't say date yet

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:01am UTC+10
But it should be fine

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:01am UTC+10
Hmm that was all meant to be one message

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:01am UTC+10
Though

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 8:01am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 7:59am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 7:59am UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 7:58am UTC+10
Well I haven't asked them yet

Luke TuthillFriday, July 10, 2015 at 7:58am UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 10, 2015 at 7:58am UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:59pm UTC+10
So you decide what to do and I will be happy with it

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:59pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:59pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:23am UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 6:08pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 6:08pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 6:06pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 6:06pm UTC+10
I wanted to wait until we were together underneath the stars to show you but okay it forms a triangle with the pointers

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 6:05pm UTC+10
It's Zeta centauri

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 6:05pm UTC+10
I've chosen a star as well

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 6:04pm UTC+10
It's well known though <3

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 6:04pm UTC+10
That's why I chose it <3

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 6:03pm UTC+10
Proxima = close <3

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 6:03pm UTC+10
The closer or the further one?

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 6:02pm UTC+10
It's one of the two pointers that point to the southern cross

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 6:01pm UTC+10
I *think* i see it

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 6:01pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 6:00pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 5:59pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 5:59pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 4:09pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 4:08pm UTC+10
Oh I dont think that's going to be a problem

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 4:07pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 8:15pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 8:08pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 8:06pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 8:06pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 8:06pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 8:06pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 8:04pm UTC+10
Keeping one instagram account is annoying for me and I don't even post anything

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 8:02pm UTC+10
Mmm that makes sense

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 8:02pm UTC+10
Keeping 3 instagram accounts is frustrating

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:46pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 5:50pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 5:46pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 5:46pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 5:46pm UTC+10

From the poet Michael Dean Dumeir

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 5:34pm UTC+10
Words aren’t enough to tell you how I feel. I want to let you know that my love is for real. I open my mouth but meaningless words come out. All these emotions and locked words make me want to shout. I just want to tell you how much you mean to me. But nothing is good enough, can’t you see? I could write poem after poem and it wouldn’t be enough. I never knew that love would be so rough. Babe, can’t you see what I’m trying to say? Probably not because this isn’t easy to convey. I could say “I love you” but what does that really mean? Does “I love you” mean anything to a teen? Those 3 words get tossed so carelessly about. You say you know how I feel but sometimes I doubt. I sat at the piano and I wrote you a song. But even through music, it still seems so wrong. The words and music just don’t come out right. So maybe I’ll try to write another poem tonight. Grab my notebook and pick up a pen. Damn it! I failed once again. Do me a favor and look at the stars. Then look at my wrists and look at my scars. The stars are to remind you that I’m always there. And the scars are proof that I really do care. I’m sorry, love, but I don’t know what else to do. So I’m just going to say that I love you…

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 5:32pm UTC+10
Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 5:27pm UTC+10
Hmm

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 5:17pm UTC+10
Dammit dad stops every 5 minutes to update Facebook

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 5:17pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 5:16pm UTC+10
Thats ok :-) have fun

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 5:09pm UTC+10
We're walking around

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 5:09pm UTC+10
Sorry I'll be off for a while

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 5:06pm UTC+10
Video call? :3

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 5:06pm UTC+10
So is nervousness related to no being able to see the person you're talking to?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 5:02pm UTC+10
With any luck

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 5:02pm UTC+10
And you were probably more innocent than you are now

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 5:01pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:56pm UTC+10
You were still beautiful before I knew you <3

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:54pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:52pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:52pm UTC+10
Tomorrow or something I don't know when I'll be available either

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:51pm UTC+10
We could try if you feel up to it :-) I don't want you to ever feel nervous talking to me

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:51pm UTC+10
Yeah

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:51pm UTC+10
I've only rung you once and that wasn't under the best circumstances

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:50pm UTC+10
I know how you feel

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:48pm UTC+10
I get really nervous for no absolute reason

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:48pm UTC+10
That's probably more important

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:47pm UTC+10
Do you want to be rung?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:47pm UTC+10
Probably not :(

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:47pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 4:46pm UTC+10

Are you okay with that? If not just don't accept and I'll get rid of it

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 3:22pm UTC+10
I changed my relationship status but a) you have to confirm it first and b) it will only be shown to my close friend group (people I trust) and whoever you've set it to appear to, although you may want to change that

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 3:17pm UTC+10
But I'm honoured you liked it <3

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 3:06pm UTC+10

And with everything that's happened

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:57pm UTC+10

I will read it for you

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:55pm UTC+10
That's a quote. One of the many actually. It's a pity you didn't read it.

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:54pm UTC+10
And I said that it wasn't a number :-P

We may compare infinities by examine which elements in one set compare to elements in another

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:53pm UTC+10
There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:52pm UTC+10
My love isn't a number and cannot be compared? :P <3

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:51pm UTC+10
Love you even more

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:49pm UTC+10
So much

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:49pm UTC+10
I love you

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:45pm UTC+10
Only because I wish the same <3

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:44pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:44pm UTC+10

We were there a few minutes ago

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:43pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:43pm UTC+10
It's an incredible opportunity

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:42pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:42pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:42pm UTC+10
Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:42pm UTC+10
Don't skip it

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:41pm UTC+10
Don't you DARE

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:24pm UTC+10
If you've fallen asleep that's absolutely adorable

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:11pm UTC+10
Imagine that we could spend the entire holidays together

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:05pm UTC+10
I would quite happily

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:05pm UTC+10
I could not go

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:05pm UTC+10
How

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:05pm UTC+10
Oh god

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:05pm UTC+10
We won't even see the same stars when we look up

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:05pm UTC+10
We're going to be so far away

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:04pm UTC+10
Next year I'm going to Switzerland

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:04pm UTC+10
Oh no I just realised

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:02pm UTC+10
Nor how much I love you

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:02pm UTC+10
How that makes me feel

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:02pm UTC+10
I cannot express

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 12:01pm UTC+10
God I love you

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:51am UTC+10
I don't want to be apart from you ever again

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:50am UTC+10
I want to hold you and never ever let you go

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:42am UTC+10
I am physically incapable of waiting

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:41am UTC+10
I can't wait

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:40am UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:39am UTC+10
As usual

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:39am UTC+10
Well I'll probably be in CR recess2 and lunch

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:39am UTC+10
But you know we both have friends

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:39am UTC+10
All the time

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:39am UTC+10
We could just be together

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:39am UTC+10
So when we get back to school are we going to stay in our groups?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:36am UTC+10
And that makes me happy

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:35am UTC+10
I'm so much happier than I was

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:35am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:30am UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:30am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:28am UTC+10
You are beautiful

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:28am UTC+10
Well I certainly haven't

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:28am UTC+10
You know, I don't think I've ever been in a relationship as intense as ours

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:23am UTC+10
<3

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:18am UTC+10
You on tiptoe on the ice

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:17am UTC+10
I cannot get that picture out of my head

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:14am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:12am UTC+10
Skater dani

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:11am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:10am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:16am UTC+10
Creativvity spelt with two vs

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:14am UTC+10
Because I lost creativvity and inspiration for the last one :P

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:14am UTC+10
It's a different thing than before

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:14am UTC+10
I'm making something for you

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:13am UTC+10
Oh okay

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:13am UTC+10
Nope They always did, but I was bored so I started noticing things

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:12am UTC+10
Are they too far back?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:12am UTC+10
It's irritating

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:11am UTC+10
My eyelashes are hitting the lenses of my glasses

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:10am UTC+10

And the longer we were apart the more our feelings grew

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:54am UTC+10
Because the longer I knew you, the more I fell in love with you

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:54am UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:37pm UTC+10
And I will try

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:37pm UTC+10
your bones

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:37pm UTC+10
And ignite

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:37pm UTC+10
I will guide you home

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:37pm UTC+10
Just what you're worth

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:37pm UTC+10
You'll never know

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:37pm UTC+10
But if you never try,

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:36pm UTC+10
To let it go

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:36pm UTC+10
When you're too in love

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:36pm UTC+10
High up above or down below?

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:36pm UTC+10
To fix you <3

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:36pm UTC+10
Try

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:36pm UTC+10
Will

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:36pm UTC+10
And I

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:36pm UTC+10
And ignite your bones

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:36pm UTC+10
You home

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:36pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:36pm UTC+10
Lights

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:34pm UTC+10
Could it be worse?

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:34pm UTC+10
But it goes to waste

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:34pm UTC+10
When you love someone,

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:34pm UTC+10
When you lose something you can't replace

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:34pm UTC+10
down your face

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:34pm UTC+10
And the tears come streaming

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:33pm UTC+10
Stuck in reverse...

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:33pm UTC+10
sleep

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:33pm UTC+10
can't

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:33pm UTC+10
But you

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:33pm UTC+10
When you feel so tired

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:33pm UTC+10
But not what you need

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:33pm UTC+10
When you get what you want

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:33pm UTC+10
When you try your best but you don't succeed

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:33pm UTC+10
Here it comes

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:32pm UTC+10
Emotional climax

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
WHy do you think I turned to the words of others? <3

Anastasia FeshinaThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
I am lost for words

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
i'm shaking

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
I have one more up my sleeve for tonight <3

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
Not swallowed in the sea

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
Yeah you belong with me

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
Not swallowed in the sea

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
You belong with me

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
Not swallowed in the sea

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
And you belong with me

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
Well that's where I belong

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
A thousand houses long

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
Ah the streets you're walking on

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
Not loving all you see

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
Forget but not forgive

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
with nothing left to give

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
Oh what good is it to live

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
And you belong with me

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
Well that's where I belong

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
A thousand houses long

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
The streets you're walking on

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
And you belong with me

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
Well that's where I belong

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
a hundred miles long

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
And I could write a song

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
Not swallowed in the sea

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
And you'll come back to me

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
Get lost and then get found

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
And spread it all around

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
And I could write it down

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
It took it back for me

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
The world and then it took

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
The one they'll say that shook

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
And I could write a book

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
What I could not see

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
Made me realise

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
You cut me down to size and opened up my eyes

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
Decided to go to sea

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:11pm UTC+10
And darling that's when I

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:11pm UTC+10
You put me on a line and hung me out to dry

Anastasia FeshinaThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:11pm UTC+10
I'm crying

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:10pm UTC+10
Or swallowed in the sea

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:10pm UTC+10
Get lost and then get found

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:10pm UTC+10
ANd spread it all around

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:10pm UTC+10
And I could write it down

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:10pm UTC+10
And you belong with me

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:10pm UTC+10
Well that's where I belong

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:10pm UTC+10
A hundred miles long

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:10pm UTC+10
And I could write a song

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
You can only blame me

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
I can only blame myself

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
And kept me for yourself

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
You put me on a shelf

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
And that's what made me se where I was going wrong

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
And brought it back to me

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
You cut me down a tree

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:06pm UTC+10
It's definitely not tears of sadness

Anastasia FeshinaThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
Please don't cry If you do, it's guaranteed that I'm going to as well

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:03pm UTC+10
I have a lump in my throat

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:03pm UTC+10
Vice versa

Anastasia FeshinaThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:02pm UTC+10
You don't realise how much you mean to me

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:02pm UTC+10
All I want is you

Anastasia FeshinaThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:02pm UTC+10
Honestly Just you Being there Is more than enough

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:02pm UTC+10
That's just a minor aspect of love though isn't it

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:02pm UTC+10
I'm looking across my room and I don't think there's one thing that I wouldn't happily give you

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:01pm UTC+10
And never stop

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:01pm UTC+10
And keep making things

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 9:01pm UTC+10
Part of me wants to make things for you

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
This shall be the best I have ever made

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
I'll brb getting equipment

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
anything

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
It won't ever be able to express

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
I've decided

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
I am going to make you something

Anastasia FeshinaThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:58pm UTC+10
All I wish for now is to be with you I love you And words are not enough to express just how much I do

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:57pm UTC+10
I'm crying

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:57pm UTC+10
I cannot get over everything that's happened and you and me and how beautiful and amazing and perfect and how much I love you and

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:56pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:45pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:44pm UTC+10
The insinuations?

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:44pm UTC+10
What have you noticed?

Anastasia FeshinaThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:44pm UTC+10
Hmm I tend to notice things

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:43pm UTC+10
I wouldn't have been able to tell if you didn't tell me

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:43pm UTC+10
And considering that English is your second language you're doing a bloody good job

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:43pm UTC+10
Do you realise the insinuations?

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
Awww <3

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
Ah okay

Anastasia FeshinaThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
An interesting way to compare the two situations

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
Can you rephrase what you said?

Anastasia FeshinaThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
I may have spelt it wrong

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:41pm UTC+10
Google has no idea

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:41pm UTC+10
That's a big word what does that mean?

Anastasia FeshinaThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:41pm UTC+10
Hmm Interesting comparacent

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:40pm UTC+10
It's sort of worse

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:40pm UTC+10
Shhh

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:40pm UTC+10
Yeah I know

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:37pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:37pm UTC+10
Ooh

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:37pm UTC+10

Okay :(

Anastasia FeshinaThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:37pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
Still packing?

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:30pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:30pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:24pm UTC+10
Perfect imperfections

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:23pm UTC+10
Especially when you're not at fault

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:22pm UTC+10
You are incredibly adept at taking blame

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:22pm UTC+10
Oh stacey

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:22pm UTC+10
Haha

Anastasia FeshinaThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:22pm UTC+10
No, it's okay It was really just me, I tend to tint happy memories with sadness

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:20pm UTC+10
I think that the opposite should have occured

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:20pm UTC+10
THat was a huge mistake

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:13pm UTC+10
You have no reason to be sorry

Anastasia FeshinaThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:12pm UTC+10
Yeah Sorry

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:12pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:08pm UTC+10
Can you see what that relates to

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:08pm UTC+10
"Pulling your puzzles apart"

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:08pm UTC+10
"I was just guessing at numbers and figures"

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:07pm UTC+10
Oh and then there's this bit

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:07pm UTC+10
"I had to find you, tell you I need you"

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:07pm UTC+10
About what happened

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 8:07pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 7:45pm UTC+10
You don't need to torrent them :P

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 7:45pm UTC+10
But songs are measured in tens of megabytes at most

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 7:44pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 4:41pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 4:41pm UTC+10
The fourth switch toggles the "menacing iron spikes" under the main walkway

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 4:41pm UTC+10
The third switch toggles the main door to the inner bailey

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 4:40pm UTC+10
The second switch toggles a drawbridge over a lava moat

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 4:40pm UTC+10
The first switch toggles a drawbridge over a river

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 4:40pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 4:01pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 4:01pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:21pm UTC+10
Question

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:21pm UTC+10
Yeah so definitely second base

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10
Ty :P

Anastasia FeshinaWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10
First base – mouth-to-mouth kissing, especially French kissing; Second base – skin-to-skin touching/kissing of the breasts; in some contexts, it may instead refer to touching any erogenous zones through the clothes (i.e. not actually touching the skin), or manual stimulation of the genitals; Third base – touching below the waist (without sexual intercourse); in some contexts, it may instead refer to oral stimulation of the genitals; Home run (home base) – "full" sexual intercourse. Additionally, Strikeout – a failure to engage in any form of foreplay or other sexual activity; Additionally, there are two metaphors used to refer to men who have sex with men: Pitching – the man performing anal sex Catching – the man receiving anal sex

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10
Just the actual metaphor bit

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:04pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:43pm UTC+10
I think that my anxiousness (over text formats) is mainly because of inability to deduce emotion

Anastasia FeshinaWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:31pm UTC+10
Hahaha

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:31pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:24pm UTC+10
:) I definitely enjoyed it

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:24pm UTC+10
I'm also worried that you'll think I'm only in this relationship for the physical side

Anastasia FeshinaWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:24pm UTC+10
Especially the cuddling

Anastasia FeshinaWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:24pm UTC+10
Well it was nice

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:22pm UTC+10
What happened today was a rare display of self-confidence

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:22pm UTC+10
It definitely helps when you physically move my hand :P

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:21pm UTC+10

As you may have noticed, I am a little bit permissive

Anastasia FeshinaWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:16pm UTC+10
Don't worry, with me, it's hard to 'cross the line'

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:15pm UTC+10
I get really anxious about where the lines are

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:15pm UTC+10
And aspergers isn't exactly working for me

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:15pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:14pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:14pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:13pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:12pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:25pm UTC+10
Slightly overweight vs slightly underweight?

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:21pm UTC+10
Hmm

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:19pm UTC+10
Not to perform

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:18pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:16pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:11pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:11pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:10pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:07pm UTC+10
Do I play a main role?

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:07pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:03pm UTC+10
If it's casual, then yeah. But if it's through the night, then I would prefer clothes off

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:00pm UTC+10
..?

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:55pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:55pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:55pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:54pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:54pm UTC+10
Depends what parts of clothing and what's being covered

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:54pm UTC+10
idm I guess

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:54pm UTC+10
Some people are partially dressed during sex. Thoughts?

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:52pm UTC+10
Your turn?

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:51pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:51pm UTC+10
Ok

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:51pm UTC+10
as visible as a boner

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:51pm UTC+10
It's not too obvious

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:50pm UTC+10
Aside from period without tampon that is

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:50pm UTC+10
Do girls literally 'get wet' and is it visible?

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:49pm UTC+10
Um Your turn?

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:49pm UTC+10
Haha

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:48pm UTC+10
i.e. ghs sport shorts

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:48pm UTC+10
Hmm

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:47pm UTC+10
You'd have to be wearing loose, thin clothing

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:46pm UTC+10
They're not that difficult to hide though

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:46pm UTC+10
But they're common

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:46pm UTC+10
Not literally

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:46pm UTC+10
All the time

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:46pm UTC+10
Anyway Have you ever had one in public?

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:45pm UTC+10
I'd rather have awkward boners than periods

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:45pm UTC+10
I'

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:45pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:43pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:43pm UTC+10
Boners*

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:43pm UTC+10
Also you don't have to worry about awkward bonerd

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:42pm UTC+10
Yeah

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:42pm UTC+10
Not as much movement

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:42pm UTC+10
I guess it's more subtle with girls

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:41pm UTC+10
Yeah a couple of times

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:40pm UTC+10
You?

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:40pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:35pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:32pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:31pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:28pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:16pm UTC+10
And I'd do whatever she wanted me to do

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:14pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:13pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:06pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 12:31pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 11:49am UTC+10
There I typed it out

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 11:48am UTC+10
Naked It kills the mood to get up and get dresses Okay since I have nothing better to do, I trusted matt quite a bit when we first got together. I would lean into his touch, enjoy it. Then slowly my trust and comfort detoriated. I hate the amount of PDA he insists on. I don't feel comfortable talking about anything personal or intimate with him. I just feel uneasy, unable to relax around him.

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 11:46am UTC+10
What would you prefer? Naked or clothed?

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 11:45am UTC+10

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:55pm UTC+10
You can think about a question to ask :-P

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:55pm UTC+10
Hmm

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:55pm UTC+10
I probably can't either

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:54pm UTC+10
I don't think

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:54pm UTC+10
And no warframe tonight sorry

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:54pm UTC+10
That's not exactly the easiest thing to think of

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:53pm UTC+10
Um

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:53pm UTC+10
Do you have something I could think about for a while?

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:53pm UTC+10
I RAN OUT OF QUESTIONS

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:52pm UTC+10
Uh

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:52pm UTC+10
Go

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:52pm UTC+10
Okay there is time for like 1 more question before I go

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:51pm UTC+10
But yeah okay

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:51pm UTC+10
The first one isn't exactly small

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:51pm UTC+10
I'm not sure

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:50pm UTC+10
Not back off when I ask them to? Say something bad about a person who I care about?

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:50pm UTC+10
*to you

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:49pm UTC+10
What's the smallest thing that someone could do for you to dump them

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:47pm UTC+10
Hmm

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:47pm UTC+10
Um Ask me something

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:46pm UTC+10
Wow

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:46pm UTC+10
Haha

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:43pm UTC+10
Probably not too kindly

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:43pm UTC+10
I wonder how kindly Aleesha would take to sexual experimentation between friends

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:41pm UTC+10
Okay :-)

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:41pm UTC+10
Just don't have time to type super-long messages

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:41pm UTC+10
Later. I'm getting ready for ballet

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:41pm UTC+10
Explain?

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:40pm UTC+10
And just don't like the way he wants things to go

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:40pm UTC+10
I do, but it's not the same

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:40pm UTC+10
Do you still love him?

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:40pm UTC+10
Hah 󾰕

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:40pm UTC+10
And disgusted

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:39pm UTC+10
But now I just feel like swatting his hand away

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:39pm UTC+10
If Aleesha saw this she'd just be disappointed

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:39pm UTC+10
I used to lean in to his touch

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:39pm UTC+10
I also feel unsafe with him

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:39pm UTC+10
Yeah

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:39pm UTC+10
God forbid he reads this

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:38pm UTC+10
No, he has a tendency to react rashly

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:38pm UTC+10
Or like he's just angry at the moment

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:38pm UTC+10
You meant like protecting you?

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:38pm UTC+10
Oh I understand

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:37pm UTC+10
Why?

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:37pm UTC+10
Haha shush 󾌪 I still have an angry boyfriend at my back

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:36pm UTC+10
I CAN FEEEEEL IT IN THE AIR

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:36pm UTC+10
UNRESOLVED SEXUAL TENSION

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:35pm UTC+10
:-P

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:35pm UTC+10
Well then.

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:35pm UTC+10
I'll let you in on another secret, I thoought of the same. I just trust you to be super gentle

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:35pm UTC+10
If I got to choose

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:34pm UTC+10
You would be my preference for my first time

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:34pm UTC+10
I'll let you in on a secret

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:33pm UTC+10
Maybe it can happen after all...

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:33pm UTC+10
I don't mind 󾍃

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:33pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:32pm UTC+10
Happened this weekend

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:32pm UTC+10
So much bad innuendo

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:32pm UTC+10
Ahhh

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:32pm UTC+10
That could change :-P

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:32pm UTC+10
I know :-)

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:32pm UTC+10
You know I don't

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:31pm UTC+10
You sound like you speak from personal experience

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:30pm UTC+10
I want the focus on me and my partner

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:30pm UTC+10
Same I think it's distracting

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:30pm UTC+10
Nah

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:29pm UTC+10
Not sure, never had sex :P

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:29pm UTC+10
Opinion on music during sex?

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:28pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:13pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:09pm UTC+10
Can you tell me what? :-P

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:09pm UTC+10
On Friday you said at some point that you were "thinking about lots of things" and you didn't tell me what

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:08pm UTC+10
OK my question

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:06pm UTC+10
If you're gonna get it that is

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:06pm UTC+10
Check how much you have and need

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:06pm UTC+10
You'll need some fieldron which is different from fieldron samples

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:05pm UTC+10
I researched it in our dojo, you can buy the bp for 15k creds

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:05pm UTC+10
It's clantech btw

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:04pm UTC+10
It being a bloody huge laser cannon

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:03pm UTC+10
And it's silent. No idea why.

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:03pm UTC+10
Kills pretty much anything in one shot

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:03pm UTC+10
No idea

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:03pm UTC+10
Perfect for spy

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:03pm UTC+10
Opticor

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:03pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:02pm UTC+10
I'll do one with you later

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:02pm UTC+10
Okay :-P

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:02pm UTC+10
*why would I even think about it?

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:02pm UTC+10
6?

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:02pm UTC+10
*?

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:02pm UTC+10
Why would I even think about 6

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:02pm UTC+10
Yeah

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:01pm UTC+10
You know how terrified I am at everything

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:01pm UTC+10
Oh wow

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:00pm UTC+10
Don't go there with just the Tipedo though

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:00pm UTC+10
Ooo have you tried the new Earth spy mission? It's on Cambria

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 6:00pm UTC+10
Nope

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 5:59pm UTC+10
Do you have a stance? You won't have the one that fits it but you'll have a staff stance that you can slot in for a few more energy

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 5:58pm UTC+10
Yeah

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 5:58pm UTC+10
Dunno how Parkour 2.0 will affect that

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 5:58pm UTC+10
Would I be okay on earth with nothing but tipedo? Want to level it up quickly

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 5:58pm UTC+10
With Tipedo and Zephyr you can go almost everywhere

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 5:56pm UTC+10
Drops from dark sectors

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 5:54pm UTC+10
Also possibly Quickening but I don't think you have that and it probably doesn't make a deifference

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 5:54pm UTC+10
Put a mazed Fury on it and soar

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 5:54pm UTC+10
I can give you the Flailing Branch (or is it bleeding willow?) stance mod for it and Berserker

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 5:51pm UTC+10
Also the galatine because there was an even that you had to have a heavy weapon for

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 5:51pm UTC+10
Except the Silva and Aegis and the kronen for a little bit

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 5:51pm UTC+10
I have used nothing since getting the Tipedo

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 5:50pm UTC+10
Piloting a blimp

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 5:50pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:25pm UTC+10
Yeap I think so

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:24pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:23pm UTC+10
Hahahahahaha

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:23pm UTC+10
I was underground for 8 hours yesterday

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:23pm UTC+10
In a cave

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:23pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:20pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:19pm UTC+10
In a train full of people

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:19pm UTC+10
Well I'm in that situation right now

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:19pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:17pm UTC+10
Has music ever made you want to violently shag someone

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:16pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:15pm UTC+10
What?

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:14pm UTC+10
Haha Alex is my spirit animal

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:12pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:12pm UTC+10
Signature

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:12pm UTC+10
Alex turned the 3G router off because I told him he couldn't use my laptop to play Kerbal Space Program

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:11pm UTC+10
Did it send in the right order

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:11pm UTC+10
Wait

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:11pm UTC+10
Crap

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:11pm UTC+10
Which is a horrifyingly small hole

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:08pm UTC+10
Did the Laundry Chute

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:07pm UTC+10
Then went into Sig

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:06pm UTC+10
Sounds fun

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:05pm UTC+10
Then went out of Dip 2

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:05pm UTC+10
Then did the 100' abseil through the Daylight hole back into Dip 2

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:05pm UTC+10
Then went out of Dip 2

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:04pm UTC+10
Haha of course

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:04pm UTC+10
I did Dip 2 which is easy but has a few optional holes that you can fit through if you're game (I was)

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:03pm UTC+10
Ok so saturday

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:00pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 4:00pm UTC+10
Haha but seriously, still alive?

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 3:59pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 3:52pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaMonday, June 8, 2015 at 3:51pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
Well getting out of a pool and having a shower feels good to me

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 9:03pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 9:02pm UTC+10
Hmm?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 9:02pm UTC+10
Hmm

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 9:00pm UTC+10
In erotica it's all loud and overdone, books and porn alike

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 9:00pm UTC+10
Yeah

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
Quiet For some reason I don't find it that arousing. Especially dirty talk

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
You?

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:58pm UTC+10
I don't really care though

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:58pm UTC+10
Quiet

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:58pm UTC+10
Dammit um Would you enjoy it more if the girl was quiet or loud

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:57pm UTC+10
Your turn?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:56pm UTC+10
True

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:56pm UTC+10
Porn doesn't exactly have a storyline to enjoy

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:56pm UTC+10
More enjoyable :-P

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:55pm UTC+10
Hahahaha

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:55pm UTC+10
That :) should not precede "watched porn?"

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:54pm UTC+10
A few times out of curiosity I find reading more enjoyable

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:54pm UTC+10
Watched porn?

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:53pm UTC+10
:-)

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:53pm UTC+10
Seeing the amount of trust I have for you

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:53pm UTC+10
Oh it's hard to go too far with me

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:52pm UTC+10
Just being careful

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:52pm UTC+10
Yeah :)

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:52pm UTC+10
You okay?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:51pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:49pm UTC+10
Your thoughts?

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:49pm UTC+10
Hm okay

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:49pm UTC+10
Depends on who you ask

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:49pm UTC+10
That's not erogenous though

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:48pm UTC+10
The prostate glan is most accesible

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:48pm UTC+10
Except in males

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:48pm UTC+10
That shouldn't even be stimulating

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:47pm UTC+10
Hah

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:47pm UTC+10
Ugh

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:47pm UTC+10
Except anal of course

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:47pm UTC+10
Both ways

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:47pm UTC+10
Go for it

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:46pm UTC+10
Thoughts on oral?

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:46pm UTC+10
If you want to stop just say

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:45pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:45pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:45pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:45pm UTC+10
Curious about anything

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:45pm UTC+10
Im running out of things to askkk

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:44pm UTC+10
Your turn?

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:44pm UTC+10
Talking about such inappropriate things

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:43pm UTC+10
She'd murder me

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
Haha

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
God I hope Aleesha doesn't see this conversation

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
Oh okay

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
Different shapes

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
Just around the entrance A thin ring of skin

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:41pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:41pm UTC+10
Just stretches

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:41pm UTC+10
Where is it?

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:41pm UTC+10
That's what the internet told me in one of my incognito browsing sessions

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:41pm UTC+10
Mhm Sometimes it doesn't break

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:41pm UTC+10
But it's not entirely accurate? Some girls don't have one, some have a partial one

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:40pm UTC+10
Medical

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:40pm UTC+10
Thats one of the official ways of determining virginity

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:40pm UTC+10
Oh okay

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
Haha

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
Nope

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
It grows back right?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
I'm not gonna ask you to answer that

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
Yeah

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
I try to be really careful since the hymen is easy to break

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
Not really fingers mostly

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
What's your record

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
Have you ever tried to put things inside yourself and if so how big

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
Weird one

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:37pm UTC+10
Okay

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
Hmm

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
Anyway go :)

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:35pm UTC+10
Haha

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:34pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:34pm UTC+10
:P

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:34pm UTC+10
:D

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:34pm UTC+10
Hmm Probably

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:33pm UTC+10
No matter what the answer is

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:33pm UTC+10
You should

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:33pm UTC+10
Hmm I don't know whether I should answer that

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:32pm UTC+10
If it were me?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:32pm UTC+10
Hmm I'd probably go for it Actually depends on the guy

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:32pm UTC+10
But I'd be quite happy for things to happen

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:31pm UTC+10
She'd probably have to start it

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:31pm UTC+10
Or would you like anything to escalate

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:31pm UTC+10
If you and a female, not gonna mention names, were trapped in a room for a while, would anything escalate? Assumimg she complies

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:30pm UTC+10
I have to be really careful with everything I do with Aleesha

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:30pm UTC+10
Besides

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:30pm UTC+10
It shouldn't be unusual

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:29pm UTC+10
Thats all

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:29pm UTC+10
Unusual

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:29pm UTC+10
Why is that?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:29pm UTC+10
It still intrigues me how considerate you are

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:28pm UTC+10
It's better for the girl apparently

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:28pm UTC+10
I'd prefer to be on the bottom

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:28pm UTC+10
Always the submissive one

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:27pm UTC+10
Don't mind really Somwhere on the bottom

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:27pm UTC+10
Sex position?

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:26pm UTC+10
Hmm

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:25pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:25pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:24pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:24pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:23pm UTC+10
Ah

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:23pm UTC+10
Basically gay sex with a close friend of mine Pretty cheerful

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:23pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:23pm UTC+10
I was hesitant

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:23pm UTC+10
Okay this one

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:22pm UTC+10
Dammit can't think of any

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:22pm UTC+10
Hmm

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:20pm UTC+10
Apart from visualisation of fanfictions

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:20pm UTC+10
Well

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:19pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:19pm UTC+10
Booooring

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:19pm UTC+10
Except without sex

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:19pm UTC+10
It probably stems from a book I read where that sort of happened

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:18pm UTC+10
Heh

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:18pm UTC+10
And the other girl warms me up

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:18pm UTC+10
And I have an accident, I dunno what exactly but I get really cold

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:17pm UTC+10
And it's me and another girl (identity varies)

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:17pm UTC+10
So I'm in like the arctic

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:16pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:16pm UTC+10
You first

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:16pm UTC+10
Swap examples?

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:16pm UTC+10
Hmm You see I really hope I don't sleep-talk

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:15pm UTC+10
And some really weird ones

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:14pm UTC+10
OH yeah.

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:14pm UTC+10
Ever had really dirty dreams?

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:12pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:12pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:12pm UTC+10
Yeah

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:12pm UTC+10
Hopefully our relationship isn't that shallow

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:12pm UTC+10
I think its gotta be about love

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:12pm UTC+10
It's quite special

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:11pm UTC+10
Not that I'm asking

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:11pm UTC+10
Nnnnnaaaaahhh

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:11pm UTC+10
Would you have sex for money?

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:10pm UTC+10
Hmm

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:10pm UTC+10
Haha

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:10pm UTC+10
Shush

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:09pm UTC+10
Okay maybe not

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:08pm UTC+10
Hmm

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:08pm UTC+10
It's the worst pain ever

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:07pm UTC+10
Con: the foreskin can be bloody annoying

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:07pm UTC+10
Hah That

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:07pm UTC+10
Pro: it doesn't hurt as much from what I've heard

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:06pm UTC+10
Wait I didn't exactly answer our question

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:06pm UTC+10
Hmm

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:06pm UTC+10
These emoticons are so crap

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:06pm UTC+10

Hmm

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:04pm UTC+10
Oh really

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:04pm UTC+10
You start wanting to go out and bang someone like a screen door in a hurricane

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:04pm UTC+10
No I don't

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:03pm UTC+10
You have no idea how much sexual frustration builds up durinf that one fucking week

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:03pm UTC+10
That's probably the big one

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:03pm UTC+10
No period

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:02pm UTC+10
In the context of sex

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:02pm UTC+10
What is the pros and cons of being male

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:02pm UTC+10
Haha

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:02pm UTC+10
God

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:02pm UTC+10
Oh no

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:01pm UTC+10
I was gonna say deepest but the pun was too bad

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:01pm UTC+10
I think this is our most personal conversation yet

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:00pm UTC+10
Hmm

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 8:00pm UTC+10
Your turn?

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:59pm UTC+10
Well I don't really know how to describe it

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:58pm UTC+10
That's terrible of me

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:58pm UTC+10
*******they're

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:58pm UTC+10
Haha

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:57pm UTC+10
Wrong their/they're/there

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:57pm UTC+10
Crap

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:57pm UTC+10
It must be because their hidden or taboo

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:57pm UTC+10
From an evolutionary perspective it doesn't make sense

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:56pm UTC+10
Well we do get aroused by them

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:56pm UTC+10
I feel like its overrated

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:56pm UTC+10
My chest is not that sensitive

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:56pm UTC+10
Oh ok

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:55pm UTC+10
They have nothing to do with that really

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:55pm UTC+10
Maybe it's because I don't have breasts

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:55pm UTC+10
I don't get that feeling

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:54pm UTC+10
There is this feeling in your chest That is really really intense

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:54pm UTC+10
Depends heavily on the situation Overwhelming Often followed by exhaustion

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:54pm UTC+10
Type type type

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:53pm UTC+10
How would you describe an orgasm?

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:52pm UTC+10
Ugh I can't dooo thisssss

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:51pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:51pm UTC+10
Yeah

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:51pm UTC+10
Haha except anal

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:50pm UTC+10
I'm up for anything so probably wouldn't make a difference

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:50pm UTC+10
You?

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:50pm UTC+10
I don't plan to

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:49pm UTC+10
Your turn

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:49pm UTC+10
I don't know what I'd do if I get drunk

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:49pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:48pm UTC+10
I don't think so

Luke TuthillFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:48pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaFriday, June 5, 2015 at 7:47pm UTC+10

Funnily enough you are the one person I truly trust

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:58pm UTC+10
I can honestly say that you're my closest friend

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:58pm UTC+10
Thank you, Luke. Same to you

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:57pm UTC+10
You're beautiful, unique and irreplaceable in my life

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:57pm UTC+10
Including you, Stacey

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:56pm UTC+10
Every person is beautiful in their own unique way

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:56pm UTC+10
People can't be compared

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:55pm UTC+10
I couldn't do that

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:55pm UTC+10
But the worst are the ones in which I am forced to decide between two people

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:54pm UTC+10
But when I have nightmares, they're always about the people I care about being killed with me not being able to help

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:53pm UTC+10
I'm not all afraid of death; in a sense I would welcome oblivion

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:52pm UTC+10
Someone once said that the worst thing about war is watching the ones you care about die

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:51pm UTC+10
Every goddamn time

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:50pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:50pm UTC+10
We crash?

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:50pm UTC+10
We get in a crash and all four of you die

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:50pm UTC+10
I am in the car, middle back seat. Its usually mum, dad, marina and you, but the people vary

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:48pm UTC+10
I have a recurring one that drives me insane

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:48pm UTC+10
Then (maybe when you're more awake), rewrite it to be happy

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:47pm UTC+10
If you wake up after one, write it down as soon as you can

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:47pm UTC+10
I have something that might help

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:46pm UTC+10
Just wake up and can't breathe Cause panic is a bitch

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:46pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:45pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:41pm UTC+10
The fact that you have slept for 6 hours in the last 24 hours

Anastasia FeshinaTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 8:41pm UTC+10

Anastasia FeshinaSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 10:23pm UTC+10
The thing is, if I tell you where they came from, your reaction may lead to a certain person being physically harmed with a fork

And you woke me up

Bronte WhiteWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:57pm UTC+10
I actually wouldn't have because all it stimulates is irritation. It's an attention grabbing tactic to draw me into a conversation.

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:55pm UTC+10
Would you have rather not known? don't answer that that was a rhetorical question to stimulate thought

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:55pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:54pm UTC+10
Because it's not for you to know yet?

Bronte WhiteWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:54pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:15pm UTC+10
On the ice

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:15pm UTC+10
Our first kiss was picturesque

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:15pm UTC+10
Mm

Tiana YoungFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:14pm UTC+10
And that jusy gives off negativity

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:14pm UTC+10
Yeah she was definitely less comfortable

Tiana YoungFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:13pm UTC+10
Jya feel

Tiana YoungFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:13pm UTC+10
Well when you're close to someone for so long it can seem way more And of course Stacey is better to you. She seems more exciting and respondent and into it. Aleesha seemed more distant. Or just less comfortable than when she talked to you that one time. She was just so attentive

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:11pm UTC+10
I don't want Aleesha to know that of course but it's true

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:11pm UTC+10
and it's so much better

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:11pm UTC+10
But then stacey

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:11pm UTC+10
And I thought I was in love with Aleesha

Tiana YoungFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:09pm UTC+10
Yeah pretty much

Tiana YoungFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:09pm UTC+10
Also sorry but I know too many Alicia 's

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:09pm UTC+10
We're still great friends and considering the lack of intimacy I guess a good friendship wont actually be much different

Tiana YoungFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:09pm UTC+10
Which is a fair deal because you were super respectful

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:09pm UTC+10
*Aleesha

Tiana YoungFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:09pm UTC+10
And it would only have surprised them because you and Alicia didn't do stuff like that

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:08pm UTC+10
Oh

Tiana YoungFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:08pm UTC+10
Like from Alicia to Stacey It's not quick but people are silly

Tiana YoungFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:07pm UTC+10
Well to most people it's pretty quick

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:07pm UTC+10
Neither do you really xD but second base on the first date surprised Jess and Eb

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:07pm UTC+10

Tiana YoungFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:05pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:05pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:05pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 7:04pm UTC+10

That didn't make any sense to me at all

Tiana YoungFriday, May 22, 2015 at 8:16pm UTC+10

Sam KellyMonday, June 29, 2015 at 9:44am UTC+10
i think the one i've used is called loopBe

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 9:43am UTC+10
Oo

Sam KellyMonday, June 29, 2015 at 9:43am UTC+10
ok so there are programs which advertise themselves as 'virtual midi cables'

Sam KellyMonday, June 29, 2015 at 9:41am UTC+10
aw man that's cool

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 9:41am UTC+10
I wanna control Dwarf Fortress macros with it

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 9:41am UTC+10
Oo how

Sam KellyMonday, June 29, 2015 at 9:41am UTC+10
but you can use it to control other stuff by bridging through live

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 9:40am UTC+10
Mmh

Sam KellyMonday, June 29, 2015 at 9:40am UTC+10
dont think you can do it

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:41am UTC+10
Without using Live?

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:41am UTC+10
Like

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:41am UTC+10
Any ideas on using the Push as a generic midi controller?

Sam KellySunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:52am UTC+10
yeah it worked =)

Luke TuthillSunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:51am UTC+10
Try that

Luke TuthillSunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:51am UTC+10
Ok it sent

Luke TuthillSunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:36am UTC+10
Sam KellySunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:31am UTC+10
xD ok

Luke TuthillSunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:27am UTC+10
of samples

Luke TuthillSunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:27am UTC+10
with 200+MBs

Luke TuthillSunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:27am UTC+10
I didn't realise that the reason that .aup files are so small is because they store all their data in another folder

Sam KellySunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:26am UTC+10
okeydokes

Luke TuthillSunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:26am UTC+10
THe audacity thing above isn't gonna work

Luke TuthillSunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:26am UTC+10
Hahaha

Sam KellySunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:26am UTC+10
gimme a sec to install audacity..

Sam KellySunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:25am UTC+10
mm

Luke TuthillSunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:25am UTC+10
.mp3 = 23MB

Luke TuthillSunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:25am UTC+10
.wav = 100MB+

Luke TuthillSunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:25am UTC+10
sooo

Luke TuthillSunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:25am UTC+10
It's the entire recording of the scene

Luke TuthillSunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:22am UTC+10
IF this doesn't work sure

Sam KellySunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:22am UTC+10
gdrive?

Sam KellySunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:22am UTC+10
i haven't tried yet

Sam KellySunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:22am UTC+10
ohk

Luke TuthillSunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:21am UTC+10
That probably won't work

Luke TuthillSunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:21am UTC+10
Waitwaitwait

Sam KellySunday, June 21, 2015 at 8:48am UTC+10
haha that's great

Luke TuthillSaturday, June 20, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10
If that tries to download as a jpeg rename it to a .aup and it'll open in audacity

Luke TuthillSaturday, June 20, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10
I can't believe that worked

Luke TuthillSaturday, June 20, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10
Hahaha

Luke TuthillSaturday, June 20, 2015 at 9:06pm UTC+10
Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 5:42pm UTC+10
*the Push

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 5:42pm UTC+10
dw I got it on th ePush

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 5:17pm UTC+10
I have no internet D:

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 5:16pm UTC+10
1 is a semitone, 2 is a tone

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 5:16pm UTC+10
Major is 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 5:16pm UTC+10
ie

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 5:16pm UTC+10
Do you know semitone patterns for a bunch of scales?

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:57am UTC+10
t

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:57am UTC+10
Riiigh

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:55am UTC+10
yeah

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:55am UTC+10
Oh right yeah expand the brackets

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:54am UTC+10
haha

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:53am UTC+10
"equate coefficients"

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:53am UTC+10
xD

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:53am UTC+10
right

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:53am UTC+10
Oh yeah

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:53am UTC+10
do you have answers?

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:52am UTC+10
ouch

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:52am UTC+10
sqrt(25-72) :(

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:52am UTC+10
(-5(+-)sqrt(25-72))/6

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:52am UTC+10
check the first expression, it might have real roots after all?

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:51am UTC+10
where alpha and beta are roots

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:51am UTC+10
alpha + beta = -b/a, alpha - beta = c/a (i think that's right, best check it)

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:50am UTC+10
hmm

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:50am UTC+10
ouch

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:50am UTC+10
Which we're not supposed to know exist

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:49am UTC+10
And 3x^2 -5x + 6 has imaginary roots

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:49am UTC+10
We haven't donnnnen this

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:49am UTC+10
3x^2 - 5x + 6 = A(x-2)^2 + B(x-2) + C, find A, B, C

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:48am UTC+10
mm?

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:48am UTC+10
I don't understaaaaand

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:48am UTC+10
Urrrgh

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:48am UTC+10
good luck with the exam

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:48am UTC+10
=) smashed it

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:43am UTC+10
That's exactly what I meant

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:43am UTC+10
Yeah

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:43am UTC+10
what you meant was both powers of 2

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:43am UTC+10
x = 3

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:43am UTC+10
2^3

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:43am UTC+10
:(

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:43am UTC+10
there's no dumb emoticon

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:43am UTC+10
but that's fine

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:42am UTC+10
it is not

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:42am UTC+10
there

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:42am UTC+10
huh!

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:42am UTC+10
8 isn't square

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:42am UTC+10
Wait what am I thinking

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:42am UTC+10
yup

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:41am UTC+10
:D two perfect squares

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:41am UTC+10
(u -1)(u-8) = 0

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:41am UTC+10
ty

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:40am UTC+10
u^2 - 9u + 8 = 0

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:40am UTC+10
yeah you can

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:40am UTC+10
MAybe

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:40am UTC+10
Mmm

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:40am UTC+10
reduce by subbing 2^x

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:40am UTC+10
ooh could you

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:40am UTC+10
maybe

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:39am UTC+10
Is that a quadratic

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:39am UTC+10
Ohh

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:38am UTC+10
ok

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:38am UTC+10
No not yet

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:38am UTC+10
The original question was 4^x - 9(2^x) + 8 = 0

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:38am UTC+10
unless you're solving for a case of x? but you don't do logs yet do you?

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:37am UTC+10
nah

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:37am UTC+10
nahh

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:37am UTC+10
one sec

Sam KellyThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:37am UTC+10
does it just

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:37am UTC+10
Halp!

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:37am UTC+10
2^(2x) + 2^3 = 9(2^x)?

Luke TuthillMonday, June 8, 2015 at 8:45pm UTC+10
It is just the coolest thing to ever exist

Sam KellyWednesday, May 27, 2015 at 7:35pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSunday, May 24, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
I'm gonna start distributing useless points

Luke TuthillSunday, May 24, 2015 at 1:00pm UTC+10
The [E1? A1? V1?] form for the night hike tomorrow

Sam KellySaturday, May 23, 2015 at 6:11pm UTC+10
i thought it was pretty good

Sam KellySaturday, May 23, 2015 at 6:11pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 6:11pm UTC+10
Jude is cool

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 6:11pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 6:11pm UTC+10
Dude does not have Facebook

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 6:11pm UTC+10
That is Jude

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 6:10pm UTC+10
That seemed like a logical proof to me

Luke Tuthill, Saskia Trost
Saskia TrostSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:51pm UTC+10
Yea I think everyone has haha

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:51pm UTC+10
I feel that I've matured since then

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:50pm UTC+10
Well that's good

Saskia TrostSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:50pm UTC+10
Yea

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:49pm UTC+10
Ah

Saskia TrostSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:49pm UTC+10
It*

Saskia TrostSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:49pm UTC+10
Eh all good. I just remember if because I broke Vanessa's scuba goggles and she hated me for like a week.

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:48pm UTC+10
I have little to no memory of the past

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10
That would be it

Saskia TrostSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10
And it was like a magic school bus play thing?

Saskia TrostSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10
Was this that time Vanessa was crying?

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:46pm UTC+10
It was a... Play? Poster? I can't remember

Saskia TrostSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:46pm UTC+10
Which thing?

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:45pm UTC+10
Pretty sure we're talking about the same thing

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:45pm UTC+10
No it was definitely my fault

Saskia TrostSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:44pm UTC+10
Kinda is because I was a massive bitch so sorry :/

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:44pm UTC+10
That's not your fault

Saskia TrostSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:43pm UTC+10
Because you said "Whenever I see you or her I'm reminded of it"

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:42pm UTC+10
Why are you sorry?

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:42pm UTC+10
And impersonal methods of conversation are easier for me

Saskia TrostSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:42pm UTC+10
Oh sorry.

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:41pm UTC+10
But I never got around to asking you about it

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:41pm UTC+10
Whenever I see you or her I'm reminded of it

Saskia TrostSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:40pm UTC+10
Why do you ask?

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:40pm UTC+10
That's okay

Saskia TrostSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:40pm UTC+10
I don't know I'm sorry.

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:39pm UTC+10
Does she still not like me

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:39pm UTC+10
What about Vanessa

Luke TuthillSaturday, May 23, 2015 at 9:39pm UTC+10

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:32pm UTC+10
I know

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:31pm UTC+10
And urrgh

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:31pm UTC+10
And I also know that I would like them

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:31pm UTC+10
If I don't tell her

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:31pm UTC+10
But I know that I won't regret it

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:31pm UTC+10
Fair enough. That's why I won't send them to you incase you regret it because I don't want to ruin your relationship

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:30pm UTC+10
Which is why I think aspergers

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:30pm UTC+10
And I should

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:30pm UTC+10
But I don't

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:30pm UTC+10
And I know I should feel bad or something because I'm not being faithful

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:29pm UTC+10
Well maybe you just need to tell her how you are feeling

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:29pm UTC+10
No

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:29pm UTC+10
But what if I aske her and she dumps me

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:29pm UTC+10
Does she have it?

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:29pm UTC+10
[Aspergers in the way of course]

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:29pm UTC+10
Like

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:29pm UTC+10
Mmh I don't know

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:28pm UTC+10
Maybe you should ask Stacey though

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:28pm UTC+10
Yeah ok

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:28pm UTC+10
:p

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:28pm UTC+10
I get the drift haha

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:28pm UTC+10
And I'm not the type of person who asks something of someone without being happy to return the favor

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:27pm UTC+10
Yay

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:27pm UTC+10
Oh

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:27pm UTC+10
Spectrum buddies :D

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:27pm UTC+10
I probably did

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:27pm UTC+10
Wait you told me xD

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:27pm UTC+10
I do too haha well I'm on the spectrum

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:26pm UTC+10
Neither honestly. Yeah you did

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:26pm UTC+10
I think that's why

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:26pm UTC+10
Idk if I told you but I have Aspergers

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:26pm UTC+10
I don't really have many limits

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:26pm UTC+10
Oh I would

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:26pm UTC+10
Yeah exactly. Do you think you would to Stacy

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:25pm UTC+10
It's fine if you're fine with it

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:25pm UTC+10
Well

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:25pm UTC+10
Ah ok

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:25pm UTC+10
I didn't want you to judge haha

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:25pm UTC+10
Because

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:18pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:18pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:16pm UTC+10

Well I haven't seen Stacey for eight days

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:15pm UTC+10
Idk it just kills me

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:15pm UTC+10
I know how you feel

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:14pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:09pm UTC+10

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:08pm UTC+10
Oh for sure. Everything I do is in incognito mode

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:08pm UTC+10
Way to kill a mood if you're expecting a cum shot nek minut a beheading

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:08pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:08pm UTC+10
But you don't know until you click it

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:08pm UTC+10
Oh that's fun

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:08pm UTC+10
Absolutely

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 7:08pm UTC+10
Hahaha do they actually show like the bad shit

He's so lucky

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:47pm UTC+10
He said you are not buying me anything but "let's take a train trip"

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:47pm UTC+10
Hahaha

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:47pm UTC+10

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:47pm UTC+10
Or both

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:47pm UTC+10
I told him he could choose between me buying him something, or something else

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:47pm UTC+10
Well

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:47pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:44pm UTC+10
I'm okay with that :)

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:41pm UTC+10
I might somewhere in the near future. Just with jack at the moment I don't want to complicate things

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:40pm UTC+10
It's completely up to you

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:40pm UTC+10
That's perfectly okay

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:37pm UTC+10
I don't know if I can do it

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:35pm UTC+10

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:26pm UTC+10
Well maybe you should have said something lol

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:26pm UTC+10
Maybe xD

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:26pm UTC+10
Luke, did at any point you ever have a crush on me

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:25pm UTC+10
But you are beautiful, Daniella

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:25pm UTC+10
And it's your decision

I don't know

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:25pm UTC+10
I just need to know why

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:24pm UTC+10
I'm sure

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:24pm UTC+10
You sure you're not just horney

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:24pm UTC+10
I don't think she will

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:23pm UTC+10
Just thing what may happen if Stacey found out

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:23pm UTC+10
I don't want to think it through xD

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:23pm UTC+10
Like if you want

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:23pm UTC+10
Maybe you should think it through

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:22pm UTC+10
That's good :)

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:22pm UTC+10

Tell me I don't mind

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:21pm UTC+10
I don't know

Urgh but... :(

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:21pm UTC+10
Probably

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:20pm UTC+10
Isn't it weird if I send you nudes and you have a gf?

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:19pm UTC+10
What do you mean

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:19pm UTC+10
Hmm?

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:19pm UTC+10
What about Stacey

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:14pm UTC+10

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:14pm UTC+10
I only do snapchat. Lol

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:14pm UTC+10

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:14pm UTC+10
Haha do you have anapchat

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:14pm UTC+10
But otherwise sure

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:13pm UTC+10
xD

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:13pm UTC+10
That was a joke if you're not serious

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:13pm UTC+10
But be careful

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:13pm UTC+10
Yeah

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:13pm UTC+10
You want my nudes?

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:11pm UTC+10
Also I'd like them too if you don't mind

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 6:11pm UTC+10
CAREFUL

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 10:26am UTC+10
Thoughts on sending nude photos to your significant other

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 10:26am UTC+10
Can I ask you something

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 10:00am UTC+10
Haha yep

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:58am UTC+10
Like two places lol

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:58am UTC+10
Well they are selective

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:58am UTC+10
Hahaha

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:50am UTC+10
Debatable xD

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:50am UTC+10
My logic anyway

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:50am UTC+10
Idk when you think about them they are just lumps of fat Like guys don't really like fat anywhere else so

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:48am UTC+10
In what way

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:47am UTC+10
Haha true there. But like they are strange things really

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:46am UTC+10
Think about what they resemble xD

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:46am UTC+10
Well that's not exactly the reason

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:45am UTC+10
I think guys just like them because they don't have their own

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:45am UTC+10
I don't think so

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:45am UTC+10
Well

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:45am UTC+10
They are not really

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:45am UTC+10
A bunch of people (girls) I've talked to say boobs are overrated

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:43am UTC+10
Mm ok

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:43am UTC+10
If girls wear a jumper out 90% of the time they're not wearing a bra

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:43am UTC+10
Honestly

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:43am UTC+10
Oh yes that sounds like fun haha

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:42am UTC+10
Which makes the whole "star wars marathon" idea muuuch better for me

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:42am UTC+10
Stacey let me in on the wonderful knowledge that girls don't wear bras whilst sleeping

Luke TuthillThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:41am UTC+10
What?

Daniella BanachThursday, July 9, 2015 at 9:40am UTC+10
And he opened my bag and was like"I'm looking for your bras"

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:53am UTC+10
Sometimes I try to explain something and just like a random noise comes out

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:53am UTC+10
Pretty much

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:53am UTC+10
They're completely useless

And yes that instagram person is me

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:25am UTC+10
I was pretty devastated like I may or may not have cried for two days but oh well some things are not meant t be so

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:24am UTC+10
:(

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:23am UTC+10
I was in love with my friend and he has a girlfriend now, we always used to do everything together and sit with each other at school and when I left we stopped talking, he messaged me and told me he really liked me but didn't think he had a chance with me but I was in love with him since year 6 so I'm kinda crushed but I'm moving on now. And me and him are still friends so it's ok I guess

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:23am UTC+10
Yeah

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:22am UTC+10
Oh fair enough sometimes like even though you are with someone if you are not happy you will keep liking someone else. Happened to me before

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:21am UTC+10
And now everything is perfect

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:21am UTC+10
And apparently stacey didn't stop liking me even though she was with two other guys consecutively

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:20am UTC+10
Friends*

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:20am UTC+10
But like if she couldn't give you the relationship you needed than fair enough for moving on just glad you still are friend a

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:19am UTC+10
Fair enough you were with Alesha for so long

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:18am UTC+10
Basically last year Stacey had a crush on me and I turned her down because Aleesha

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:18am UTC+10
He is lovely I met him at of mice and men

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:18am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:17am UTC+10
Well that's interesting

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:17am UTC+10
How long have you been with her?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:17am UTC+10
I don't understand how one person can be so amazing

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:17am UTC+10
And we have an anniversary and I love her and she's perfect

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:16am UTC+10
Yeah ok

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:16am UTC+10
Hmm ok that was weird

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:16am UTC+10
Testy test

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:14am UTC+10
Nawww :3 mine was on the ice haha but like near the back barrier

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:14am UTC+10
It was on the ice and she was on tiptoe and awww :3

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:14am UTC+10
I'm sort of in a relationship

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:13am UTC+10
Haha okay

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:13am UTC+10
That's so good. I wasted mine so glad you had a good one

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:13am UTC+10
First kiss that meant anything <3

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:13am UTC+10
It's absolutely perfect

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:13am UTC+10
Happy for you haha

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:13am UTC+10
Oh that's so good

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:12am UTC+10
Yep

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:12am UTC+10
Are you with her?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:12am UTC+10
Yeah you probably have

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:12am UTC+10
I'm pretty sure i have met her

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:11am UTC+10
She doesn't do lessons

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:11am UTC+10
Small russian and can skate fairly well

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:11am UTC+10
Maybe though

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:11am UTC+10
Possibly I don't think

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:11am UTC+10
Do you know Stacey?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:11am UTC+10
wait

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:10am UTC+10
Buttttt

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:10am UTC+10
Yeah exactly that's fair enough. You never know like in a few years she might be ready

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:10am UTC+10
I guess with the lack of intimacy in it there won't actually be much difference just being friends

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:10am UTC+10
And all good my internet is pretty crappy I'm using data

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:10am UTC+10
Yeah we're still friends

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:09am UTC+10
Fair enough at least it's on good terms

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:09am UTC+10
Wait not anymore... Hmm

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:09am UTC+10
Crap everything is taking so long to send

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:09am UTC+10
We could both sorta see that she wasn't ready for the relationship I wanted

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:09am UTC+10
It was a happy breakup

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:09am UTC+10
No it's ok

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:09am UTC+10
Are you ok

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:08am UTC+10
Oh I'm sorry to hear that 󾌣

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:08am UTC+10
I'm no longer with Aleesha

Daniella BanachFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:08am UTC+10

Luke TuthillSunday, May 24, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
But you should collect them anyway

Luke TuthillSunday, May 24, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
They're useless

Luke TuthillSunday, May 24, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10

Alex TuthillWednesday, May 27, 2015 at 7:12pm UTC+10
Yes, ik right

Luke TuthillWednesday, May 27, 2015 at 7:12pm UTC+10
That's exactly what I was about to say

Luke TuthillWednesday, May 27, 2015 at 7:11pm UTC+10
Cat eating donut

Luke TuthillWednesday, May 27, 2015 at 7:11pm UTC+10
Indeed

Luke TuthillWednesday, May 27, 2015 at 7:11pm UTC+10
Ah yes

Alex TuthillWednesday, May 27, 2015 at 7:11pm UTC+10
Luke TuthillWednesday, May 27, 2015 at 7:11pm UTC+10
Good

Alex TuthillWednesday, May 27, 2015 at 7:11pm UTC+10
That's the last thing I'd expect you to do

Luke TuthillWednesday, May 27, 2015 at 7:10pm UTC+10
Haha don't worry I'm not gonna steal her

Luke TuthillWednesday, May 27, 2015 at 7:10pm UTC+10
That's not what it's telling me

Alex TuthillWednesday, May 27, 2015 at 7:10pm UTC+10
And why r u so interested anyway

Alex TuthillWednesday, May 27, 2015 at 7:10pm UTC+10
I didn't, she did

Luke TuthillWednesday, May 27, 2015 at 7:09pm UTC+10
If you didn't want it to be publicly available knowledge, you shouldn't have put it on Facebook. :P

Luke TuthillWednesday, May 27, 2015 at 7:09pm UTC+10
You should probably just accept it if someone says that you're cute with <girlfriend name>. You're not gonna be able to convince them otherwise, so why bother?

April Thompson, Luke Tuthill
Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 11:07pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:55pm UTC+10
Ok :0

April ThompsonWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:54pm UTC+10
I won't, that's alright, if you change your mind I've got a whole heap of people and I'm going to have to ask some people to sit it out anyway so just tell me and I'll understand :)

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:53pm UTC+10
I'll probably come along and it probably won't affect me and everything will be happy but just forewarning

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:53pm UTC+10
Mm well don't bother looking it up or anything

April ThompsonWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:53pm UTC+10
If you're not sure you can always sit it out but I don't know enough about the syndrome to say if you should do it, that's up to you

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:52pm UTC+10
I dunno

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:52pm UTC+10
Mm

April ThompsonWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:52pm UTC+10
With the big brother thing?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:52pm UTC+10
But idk if I'm going to work with this

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:52pm UTC+10
Don't say the stuff about not judging and all that; I know; Ive accepted it and yay

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:51pm UTC+10
It increases logic skills with a sharp decrease in socail skills

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:51pm UTC+10
I have Aspergers

April ThompsonWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:50pm UTC+10
what's up

April ThompsonWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:50pm UTC+10
we are now

April ThompsonWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:50pm UTC+10
hey

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:47pm UTC+10
Are we both online

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:47pm UTC+10
Hello?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:51pm UTC+10
bloop?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 7:35am UTC+10
And it was sort of eleven thirty :-P

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 7:32am UTC+10
Sorry had no internet

April ThompsonTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 11:22pm UTC+10
what's up?

April ThompsonTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 11:22pm UTC+10
sorry, my phones connected to the internet but I haven't checked it, that's probably why

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 6:13pm UTC+10
Untrustworthy facebook

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 6:13pm UTC+10
Hmm it *says* you are

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 6:05pm UTC+10
But I'll wait till we're both online to discuss it to you

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 6:05pm UTC+10
There's a thing you should know about me

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 6:04pm UTC+10
Um

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 6:02pm UTC+10
Good job :D

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 6:02pm UTC+10
I didn't think it was this formal

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 6:02pm UTC+10
You have put a lot of work into this

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 6:01pm UTC+10
I'm just reading the email you sent out

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 6:01pm UTC+10
Whoa

April ThompsonThursday, June 18, 2015 at 6:48pm UTC+10
Hey, yeah I tthink

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 7:58am UTC+10
Are these messages coming through

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 16, 2015 at 10:16pm UTC+10
April ThompsonTuesday, June 16, 2015 at 10:13pm UTC+10
So no stress

April ThompsonTuesday, June 16, 2015 at 10:13pm UTC+10
This time next week I'll start emailing everything out and it will start next term week 2

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 16, 2015 at 10:13pm UTC+10
OK cool

April ThompsonTuesday, June 16, 2015 at 10:10pm UTC+10
Tomorrow nothing

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 16, 2015 at 9:43pm UTC+10
Yeah that

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 16, 2015 at 9:43pm UTC+10

in regards to the

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 16, 2015 at 9:35pm UTC+10
What's happening tomorrow?

April ThompsonFriday, June 12, 2015 at 7:45pm UTC+10
Hahaha thank you

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 7:45pm UTC+10
atraguliauniliantauthr@gmail.com

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 7:45pm UTC+10
That could be problematic

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 7:45pm UTC+10
Um

April ThompsonFriday, June 12, 2015 at 7:44pm UTC+10
Hey, that's totally cool, I'll put your name down and add you to the group, what's your email?

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 7:43pm UTC+10
Hey how do I come to that thing you organized? I'm not doing the physics Olympiad

April ThompsonThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:56pm UTC+10
Thanks, I tried to make it interesting

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:55pm UTC+10
And it's still really good

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:55pm UTC+10
It's still yours

April ThompsonThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:50pm UTC+10
yeah, although I was inspired by peer support so it's not a completely original idea

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:47pm UTC+10
Is it your idea?

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:47pm UTC+10
Yeah

April ThompsonThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:47pm UTC+10
haha, no, hopefully if anyone needs help with a subject in particular or something then everyone will know one of us who's good at it and could help so that's actually good

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:46pm UTC+10
Awesome

April ThompsonThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:46pm UTC+10
no?

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:46pm UTC+10
I'm not good with emotions

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:46pm UTC+10
Sarcasm?

April ThompsonThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:43pm UTC+10
I'll make sure to keep that in mind

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:43pm UTC+10
If any of your mentorees (???) needs computer help I'm available

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:43pm UTC+10
Although

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:42pm UTC+10
Haha true

April ThompsonThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:41pm UTC+10
eh, almost everyone in our year is a genius so you can probably claim the title anyway

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:41pm UTC+10
and that doesn't make me a genius...

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:41pm UTC+10
It is

April ThompsonThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:41pm UTC+10
no? I thought physics was like, super hard

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:40pm UTC+10
That's not true...

April ThompsonThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:40pm UTC+10
yeah, small price to pay for being a genius I guess

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:40pm UTC+10
I'd honestly love to but physssicss

April ThompsonThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:40pm UTC+10
ohk haha, I thought maybe you'd be interested in mentoring

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:39pm UTC+10
Just to talk

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 6:39pm UTC+10
There wasn't actually any particular topic I wanted to talk about

Yeah

Holly BrassellThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:23pm UTC+10
Yeah it's dissapointing isn't it, it's never what you hope for haha

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:22pm UTC+10
That smiley did not correctly convey the emotion I meant

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:22pm UTC+10
Ew

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:22pm UTC+10
Rhetorically wonder that is :-P

Holly BrassellThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:21pm UTC+10
I have no idea honestly

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:21pm UTC+10
I wonder if everyone else kept theirs

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10
Whoa

Holly BrassellThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10
I'm sure I did, it's probably with all my books from the oc

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10
And even cooler if you kept the one I gave you

Holly BrassellThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10
Oh that is so sweet! I remember you doing origami yeah :)

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:19pm UTC+10
It would be cool if you did remember

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:18pm UTC+10
I don't know if you remember back to year six

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
I made him an origami dragon

Holly BrassellThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
What's that?

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
I did something that I haven't done in a looong time

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
Mmh

Holly BrassellThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
Yeah that's what he told me, leaving on Sunday

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
I don't know if his plans were the same then as they are now, but tomorrow's his last day

Holly BrassellThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
I know he told me on Monday..

Luke TuthillThursday, May 28, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
Jarvis is leaving...

Jarvis CarrollSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:31pm UTC+10
We should do two and swap mutually

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:30pm UTC+10
Well start then

Jarvis CarrollSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:30pm UTC+10
Although I did want to start

Haha okay

Jarvis CarrollSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:30pm UTC+10
Patience

Jarvis CarrollSaturday, July 11, 2015 at 4:30pm UTC+10
You should start I'm losing motivation

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 8, 2015 at 9:25am UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 8, 2015 at 9:25am UTC+10
I was John kicked off the computer last night

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 8, 2015 at 8:11am UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 8, 2015 at 8:11am UTC+10
The DF world

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 8, 2015 at 8:11am UTC+10
Did you start

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10
Pretty cool

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10
Would that be

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10
How cool

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10
She wants to go on a double date

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:45pm UTC+10
Yeah

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:45pm UTC+10
Like she and I spent more time talking about scent

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:44pm UTC+10
Cool

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:44pm UTC+10
But I see things now

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:44pm UTC+10
Stuff

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:44pm UTC+10
You would talk to me about different things to what she would and

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:43pm UTC+10
But like

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:43pm UTC+10
Although I guess yeah

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:43pm UTC+10
okay well I do

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:43pm UTC+10
Not really?

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:43pm UTC+10
Notive how similar our situations are?

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:42pm UTC+10
Ya

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:42pm UTC+10
She's told you about her new relationship?

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:42pm UTC+10
So I hear

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:41pm UTC+10
And now we're friends

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:41pm UTC+10
Hey

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:41pm UTC+10
I remembered her from when you and kik and stuff ages ago so I was like

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:40pm UTC+10
Ahuh

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 9:40pm UTC+10
You met Dani?

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:45pm UTC+10
Yeah

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:45pm UTC+10
oh yeah that right

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:45pm UTC+10
and you end up getting good at it but noone else can be stuffed

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:45pm UTC+10
Yeah

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:45pm UTC+10
You have to think outside the box literally

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:45pm UTC+10
that's what those are meant to be

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:45pm UTC+10
It's interestingly difficult to get between some of them

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:44pm UTC+10
I like it

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:44pm UTC+10
Just the way

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:44pm UTC+10
Beautiful yet totally inefficient

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:44pm UTC+10
Dats my password

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:44pm UTC+10
Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:43pm UTC+10
That's not what I meant to do

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:43pm UTC+10
o.o

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:43pm UTC+10
What

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:43pm UTC+10
Jarvis CarrollTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:41pm UTC+10
hm okay

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:41pm UTC+10
You start

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 3:41pm UTC+10
We should do a shared DF game

Luke TuthillTuesday, July 7, 2015 at 6:53am UTC+10
Awesome

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 11:13pm UTC+10
Anyways I realized that you'd died which is why I started venting ttyl

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 11:12pm UTC+10
But mm

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 11:08pm UTC+10
Well maybe she did but in an exotic way like that's J who does his number stuff

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 11:07pm UTC+10
Like she didn't love the fact that I get fascinated by mathsy nerd stuff

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 11:06pm UTC+10
Although eventually I started feeling alienated and alone and so whatever she did feel wasn't 'right'

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 11:05pm UTC+10
So reciprocation is a weird one

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 11:04pm UTC+10
How that works

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 11:04pm UTC+10
And later that made it hard for me to appreciate how she felt about me idk why

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 11:03pm UTC+10
She often struggled to believe how I felt about her

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 11:02pm UTC+10
A weird thing about us though was reciprocation

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 11:01pm UTC+10
And them we'd meet and hug and everything would be fine and somehow more rational

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 11:00pm UTC+10
We pretty much only ever fought when apart

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 11:00pm UTC+10
Emotion just gets stronger in general

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 11:00pm UTC+10
Actually that works both ways

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 11:00pm UTC+10
Yeah definitely

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 11:00pm UTC+10
In my experience with Kath emotions got much more problem ish when distance and holidays

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:59pm UTC+10
Wifi might turn off soon

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:58pm UTC+10
It's going to make the SDD project interesting

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:58pm UTC+10
I dunno

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:58pm UTC+10
Her sister Tamsin actually alerted me to her not-okayness; I guess when we see each other in person things might work out

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:58pm UTC+10
If it doesn't work out I lose something very important: her friendship

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:57pm UTC+10
I did love her company and I loved talking to her

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:57pm UTC+10
Not entirely true though

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:56pm UTC+10
That's a harsh way of putting it yeah

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:56pm UTC+10
And that wasn't obvious before but now it is

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:56pm UTC+10
You were effectively in a one sided relationship and so she's the only one losing from that half relationship ending

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:55pm UTC+10
But I wanted her to be happy I don't care about me

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:54pm UTC+10
I think we're sort of okay now

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:54pm UTC+10
Well it's just not fair on you

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:54pm UTC+10
And I had no idea what to do

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:54pm UTC+10
"I didn't think I'd feel like this"

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:54pm UTC+10
But she's not

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:54pm UTC+10
And I assumed that by saying that she thought she was going to be happy

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:53pm UTC+10
I see

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:53pm UTC+10
I thought that she was ok -- she told me "You should go out with Stacey"

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:53pm UTC+10
Everything's going to be different

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:52pm UTC+10
She and I... I don't really know what's happening

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:52pm UTC+10
I make a habit of open minded ness and appreciating sides and unbiasing

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:52pm UTC+10
I didn't just mean to you I meant to myself

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:52pm UTC+10
Oh right

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:52pm UTC+10
Which concern

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:51pm UTC+10
Sorry?

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:51pm UTC+10
Make me the exception to that concern

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:51pm UTC+10
It's a wonderful thing

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:51pm UTC+10
Yeah

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:51pm UTC+10
And I don't want to

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:51pm UTC+10
Reciprocation?

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:51pm UTC+10
I feel like I'm putting Aleesha in a bad light

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:50pm UTC+10
With aleesha that didn't happen

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:50pm UTC+10
The big thing for me is my feelings been met

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:50pm UTC+10
Shudup xD

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:49pm UTC+10
And the train trip home

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:49pm UTC+10
Oh right school forgot

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:49pm UTC+10
Then at homegroups and at second recess and then we have all of lunch

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:49pm UTC+10
Ah cool you should look forward to that

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:49pm UTC+10
We first see each other at first recess

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:49pm UTC+10
That's decided xD

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:48pm UTC+10
Well we're going to make out

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:48pm UTC+10
No

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:48pm UTC+10
Well did I tell you about Tuesday and what's probably going to happen?

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:47pm UTC+10
Yeah

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:47pm UTC+10
Yeah it's amazing how much of a relationship is actually dependant on comfort as opposed to other superficial stuff

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:46pm UTC+10
But we haven't seen each other since wednesday

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:44pm UTC+10
And much harder to cross

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:42pm UTC+10
Well the lines are significantly higher now

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:42pm UTC+10
One of the best things is that when I was with Aleesha I was always afraid of crossing lines

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:41pm UTC+10
She's accepting and beautiful

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:41pm UTC+10
Idk much about S's personality

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:40pm UTC+10
Kk good

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:40pm UTC+10
I am sincerely fine with you talking about it btw. It doesn't feel like bragging or anything

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:39pm UTC+10
It's true love and it's amazing

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:36pm UTC+10
That's super

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:36pm UTC+10
Programming is my love atm

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:36pm UTC+10
I am having the time of my life

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:36pm UTC+10
Ha have fun

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:35pm UTC+10
Bloop

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:35pm UTC+10
Bleep

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:26pm UTC+10
Well I think I'm more interested in love than programming at the moment

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:22pm UTC+10
I'm not sure whether or not it should have an imperative layer

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:21pm UTC+10
I feel like you'll get places

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:21pm UTC+10
Oh that's good

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:21pm UTC+10
I think I might make it like not functional or object based

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:20pm UTC+10
Okay

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:20pm UTC+10
I am going through the ideas in my head

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:20pm UTC+10
Well do it

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:19pm UTC+10
I want to write my own language

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 5:49pm UTC+10
Or haskell

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 5:49pm UTC+10
Probably C++

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 5:49pm UTC+10
Cool I've been thinking of learning something C

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 3:13pm UTC+10
ie C++11

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 3:13pm UTC+10
C++

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 3:11pm UTC+10
What language is the list thing

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 3:11pm UTC+10
Oh yeah Haskell is cool I've never used it though

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 2:30pm UTC+10
btw it exists in C++11 so thhbllt

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 2:29pm UTC+10
oh hey "dynamic typing" as you call it actually has uses

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 1:25pm UTC+10
what

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 1:25pm UTC+10
0.2 seconds to merge and sort a map of 50,000 elements

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 1:24pm UTC+10
WHAT

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 1:24pm UTC+10
that is separate but WHAT

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 1:24pm UTC+10
http://stackoverflow.com/a/15330751

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 12:43pm UTC+10
as opposed to making function members

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 12:43pm UTC+10
you can alias a name to a tuple format and make functions that deal with that alias

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 12:43pm UTC+10
at all

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 12:43pm UTC+10
so you just don't have classes

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 12:42pm UTC+10
it is function based

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 12:42pm UTC+10
it isn't object based

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 12:42pm UTC+10
look it up

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 12:42pm UTC+10
Haskell

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 12:36pm UTC+10
What do you mean by functional

Luke TuthillMonday, July 6, 2015 at 12:36pm UTC+10
Hello

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 10:52am UTC+10
the song's good

Jarvis CarrollMonday, July 6, 2015 at 9:30am UTC+10
have you considered learning a functional programming language?

Jarvis CarrollSunday, July 5, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
setting up git extensions holy moly

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:45am UTC+10
Oh cool

Jarvis CarrollFriday, July 3, 2015 at 11:44am UTC+10
OMG I JUST REMEMBERED WHY I MADE THAT THING

Jarvis CarrollFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:35am UTC+10
luvit

Jarvis CarrollFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:35am UTC+10

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:33am UTC+10
And this is going to be REALLY cheesy or sappy or like sad

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:33am UTC+10
I'm making a song for stacey

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:09am UTC+10
Shhh

Jarvis CarrollFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:09am UTC+10
I noticed in the fact that I made it

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:08am UTC+10
Relephants

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:08am UTC+10
That's a phrase I stole from you btw

Jarvis CarrollFriday, July 3, 2015 at 10:07am UTC+10
haha

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 7:57pm UTC+10
There are relephants

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 7:57pm UTC+10
Look at the lyrics http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/coldplay/thescientist.html

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 7:57pm UTC+10
But thiiiink about it

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 7:57pm UTC+10
Apparently she melted

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 7:56pm UTC+10
I just serenaded Stacey with The Scientist

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 7:31pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 4:42pm UTC+10
*DF

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 4:42pm UTC+10
I LIKE FD

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 4:42pm UTC+10
There are also giant axe blade traps and cage traps And a fortified wall with archer spots

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 4:42pm UTC+10
I like my fortress It is defendable I have a room with five switches in it The first switch toggles a drawbridge over a river The second switch toggles a drawbridge over a lava moat The third switch toggles the main door to the inner bailey The fourth switch toggles the "menacing iron spikes" under the main walkway And the fifth switch collapses the entire roof of the main hallway

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 12:53pm UTC+10
Does this mean I have a vowel fetish?

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 12:53pm UTC+10
That's FIVE vowels

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 12:53pm UTC+10
Anastasia

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 12:53pm UTC+10
Remember the vowel thing

Luke TuthillThursday, July 2, 2015 at 12:53pm UTC+10
I discovered the real reason why I'm in love with Stacey

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 11:07pm UTC+10
bye bye

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 11:06pm UTC+10
Vale

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 11:00pm UTC+10
Yeah

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 11:00pm UTC+10
interesting and sucky

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:58pm UTC+10
also they're watching the terminator and I haven't seen the other ones

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:57pm UTC+10
It was but stacey's group are going to watch a movie and she wants to go cuz she won't see her friends for the whole holidays and her last boyfriend is going therefore it would be problematic if I came

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:56pm UTC+10
Unfortunately

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:56pm UTC+10
Nah

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:56pm UTC+10
so another thing happening tomorrow right?

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:31pm UTC+10
cuz you have no idea what they are talking about in any way

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:31pm UTC+10
if it is genuine empathy you're just lying

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:31pm UTC+10
I see what you mean

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:30pm UTC+10
it's not empathy it's delusive sympathy

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:30pm UTC+10
Ah

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:30pm UTC+10
like childbirth turns into genital explosion turns into severe being kicked in the crotch turns into ow that must really hurt

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:30pm UTC+10
it's crap

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:30pm UTC+10
yeah but when you empathise with something you just associate it with something you have experienced

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:29pm UTC+10
Empathy is where you haven't experienced it yourself?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:29pm UTC+10
I love it

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:29pm UTC+10
everything is sympathise

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:28pm UTC+10
eh hate that distinction

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:28pm UTC+10
Empathise not sympathise

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:28pm UTC+10
Ah k

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:28pm UTC+10
only generally

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:28pm UTC+10
but I don't relate to that specifically

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:28pm UTC+10
like moments like that that are the best

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:25pm UTC+10
What did you mean by not heartbeats for me?

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:24pm UTC+10
yeah that : P

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:23pm UTC+10
By rules I guess you mean social rules not each other's rules

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:23pm UTC+10
Mm

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:22pm UTC+10
anything else ought to be new and amazing and unexpected

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:22pm UTC+10
and like I will probably have 2 normal relationships in my life tops but

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:21pm UTC+10
like unconventional

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:21pm UTC+10
I have had two relationships one was eh and the other was really weird

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:21pm UTC+10
and like

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:21pm UTC+10
um I've been thinking recently how the only real kind of relationship is one where you break half the rules

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:21pm UTC+10
?

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:20pm UTC+10
not heartbeats for me but yeah

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:20pm UTC+10
but yeah

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:20pm UTC+10
hahahahaha cute

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:20pm UTC+10
That was amazing

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:20pm UTC+10
I think one of the best things was when we were so close we could feel each other's heartbeats

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:19pm UTC+10
: ))

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:19pm UTC+10
And now we can have anniversaries and :D

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:18pm UTC+10
oh right

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:18pm UTC+10
P

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:18pm UTC+10
:

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:18pm UTC+10
or second base whatever you prefer

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:18pm UTC+10
That seemed weird to me because we've been 'together' for a loooong time

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:18pm UTC+10
6?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:18pm UTC+10
People (jess and ebony) seemed surprised that we were up to 6 on the first date

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:17pm UTC+10
It's absolutely perfect because it's a relationship grown out of a friendship grown out fo the relationship

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:17pm UTC+10
Yeah

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:17pm UTC+10
We started cuddling after that

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:17pm UTC+10
it's what will make it strong

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:17pm UTC+10
okay well yeah I started saying things but I didn't have time

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:16pm UTC+10
It was probably what sparked the relationship

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:16pm UTC+10
Oh yeah we crossed all of those lines a LONG time ago

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:16pm UTC+10
I just meant talking about things explicitly

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:16pm UTC+10
with you and her or me andd anyone

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:16pm UTC+10
Kk

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:16pm UTC+10
oh yeah no I don't even think about sex I'm mostly asexual usually

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:15pm UTC+10
I knew that before we discussed it

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:15pm UTC+10
when I say lots of course

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:15pm UTC+10
and the time you spend worrying about it, lots of things will become more okay and yeah

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:15pm UTC+10
Well I know that there's definitely no sex until she's sixteen

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:15pm UTC+10
um yeah it'll be fine though cuz every line will get crossed eventually and then you'll know

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:14pm UTC+10
but there actually was a boundary that was good to keep behind so gj me

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:14pm UTC+10
I do remember worrying about getting to sexually explicit with Kathryn come to think of it

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:14pm UTC+10
since I realised that acquaintances are completely meaningless

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:13pm UTC+10
idk who I've thought that about though because I get close to people a lot these days

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:13pm UTC+10
That's it exactly

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:13pm UTC+10
Yeah

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:13pm UTC+10
cuz you know but you like don't know

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:13pm UTC+10
yeah I relate to that a bit

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:12pm UTC+10
I'm incredibly anxious about crossing lines even though she said that it's hard to cross lines with her

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:12pm UTC+10
but yeah go for it I'm not jealouss or anything it just makes me more happy with the idea of becoming intimate with a person again some day

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:12pm UTC+10
I agree

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:11pm UTC+10
noone warns you what you end up discussing with magical people and how personal it is hey

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:11pm UTC+10
:p

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:11pm UTC+10
Should I talk about how great it is

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:11pm UTC+10
is pretty golly cool

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:11pm UTC+10
it

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:11pm UTC+10
yeah I'm sure

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:10pm UTC+10
It's the best feeling

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:10pm UTC+10
An actual relationship

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:10pm UTC+10
LIke

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:10pm UTC+10
This is so great

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:10pm UTC+10
moving on

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:10pm UTC+10
Fall out boy

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:09pm UTC+10
um what do I want to know about stacey what music does she like

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:09pm UTC+10
:P

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:09pm UTC+10
kk

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:09pm UTC+10
I don't think so

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:09pm UTC+10
Ok um what do you want to know about Stacey?

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:09pm UTC+10
should I talk about my current love of programming

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:08pm UTC+10
m

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:08pm UTC+10
We were subtle

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:08pm UTC+10
Up to 6 though

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:08pm UTC+10
No I don't think so

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:07pm UTC+10
doubt you managed that in Erina

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:07pm UTC+10
Cool k

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:07pm UTC+10
oh no I remember it being described as "8: 7 but with no clothes on"

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:06pm UTC+10
or just nudity I guess

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:06pm UTC+10
like 7 but skin

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:06pm UTC+10
quick quick

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:06pm UTC+10
what do you mean by skin?

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:03pm UTC+10
talk about your girly some more

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:03pm UTC+10
ya

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:02pm UTC+10
Ok cool

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:02pm UTC+10
2400 estimate

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:02pm UTC+10
hm maybe 6 was erogenous (breast) and 7 was genital, 8 was skin and 9 was oral intercourse and 10 was sex

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:01pm UTC+10
I'll send you a screenshot when I have internet

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:01pm UTC+10
My dwarves have run out of shell :(

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:01pm UTC+10
Noooo it's not

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 10:00pm UTC+10
shame

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:59pm UTC+10
Haha I wasn't offering

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:59pm UTC+10
me too maybe you can touch my erogenousness too

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:59pm UTC+10
Stacey's neck is really sensitive

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:59pm UTC+10
GOOD

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:59pm UTC+10
and doesn't make hand holding "strike out"

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:59pm UTC+10
Kk awesome

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:58pm UTC+10
it puts a lot more weight on the other things that are also important

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:58pm UTC+10
I'm not sure if I'm ahead of the scale or something but that's the idea

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:58pm UTC+10
7. unclothed erotic contact

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:57pm UTC+10
6. clothed erotic contact

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:57pm UTC+10
5. open kiss

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:57pm UTC+10
4. kiss

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:57pm UTC+10
3. cheek kiss

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:57pm UTC+10
2. holding hands

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:56pm UTC+10
1. hug

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:56pm UTC+10
um so it's like

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:56pm UTC+10
the last two or three vary in the same way that base 2 and 3 vary in that

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:56pm UTC+10
I have no internet but I'll google it tomorrow

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:56pm UTC+10
Kk

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:56pm UTC+10
I don't remember exactly but same principle scaling from 1 hugging to 10 sex

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:55pm UTC+10
It sounds better explain

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:55pm UTC+10
Well I don't know the ten point scale

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:55pm UTC+10
Mm ok

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:55pm UTC+10
it goes against my pro-performance model of sex and my asexuality

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:55pm UTC+10
Ah true

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:55pm UTC+10
I always preferred ten point scale of intimacy but the way that baseball talks about intercourse as a goal and associates each level as being fundumentally associated with a quantity of success

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:54pm UTC+10
?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:54pm UTC+10
Why is that

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:54pm UTC+10
yeah I don't like that even more now

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:53pm UTC+10
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_metaphors_for_sex

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:52pm UTC+10
First base – mouth-to-mouth kissing, especially French kissing; Second base – skin-to-skin touching/kissing of the breasts; in some contexts, it may instead refer to touching any erogenous zones through the clothes (i.e. not actually touching the skin), or manual stimulation of the genitals; Third base – touching below the waist (without sexual intercourse); in some contexts, it may instead refer to oral stimulation of the genitals; Home run (home base) – "full" sexual intercourse. Additionally, Strikeout – a failure to engage in any form of foreplay or other sexual activity; Additionally, there are two metaphors used to refer to men who have sex with men: Pitching – the man performing anal sex Catching – the man receiving anal sex

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:52pm UTC+10
oh right got it

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:52pm UTC+10
darn can't remember second base

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:51pm UTC+10
And lots of I love yous

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:51pm UTC+10
And um second base

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:51pm UTC+10
She was on tiptoes and she kissed me and we were on the ice and it was like one of those awful disney cliche movies but somehow perfect

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:50pm UTC+10
:333

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:50pm UTC+10
: 3

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:50pm UTC+10
And first kiss was picturesque

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:50pm UTC+10
Absolutely perfect

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:50pm UTC+10
And you know that outdoor place with the stage and th eplaygroud well we just snuggled there in one of the chairs

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:50pm UTC+10
And we bought donuts

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:50pm UTC+10
yeahh

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:50pm UTC+10
no plans so free time

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:50pm UTC+10
Then stacey and I just walked around erina

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:49pm UTC+10
BUT

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:49pm UTC+10
Soo we got kicked off

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:49pm UTC+10
Well it was actually a two hour one starting at 10:30

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:49pm UTC+10
*11:30

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:49pm UTC+10
Jacob said that the session was a 3h one starting a 11:00

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:48pm UTC+10
And it gets better

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:48pm UTC+10
Haha yeah it was perfect

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:48pm UTC+10
before that what I always wanted

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:48pm UTC+10
well I'm in a cynical spell of aromance at the moment but

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:48pm UTC+10
that's like everything I ever wanted

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:48pm UTC+10
Which was an unexpected and probably set up turn of events

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:48pm UTC+10
: O

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:48pm UTC+10
John and jacob didn't turn up

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10
Except um

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10
John, Stacey and Jacob

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10
oooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10
ohhhhhhh

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10
Today I went skating

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10
I came back to Tactics as I started to share, and

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10
Anyway

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10
Pretty great

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10
how cool is programming

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10
Yeah I will

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:46pm UTC+10
seriously though you should use all your gems to encrust otherwise go die

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:45pm UTC+10
I'll quickly make a bookkeeper

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:45pm UTC+10
and 400 bracelets

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:45pm UTC+10
300 earrings

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:45pm UTC+10
300 reings

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:45pm UTC+10
s

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:45pm UTC+10
Haven't got a bookeeper yet so these are just estimate

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:44pm UTC+10
xD

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:44pm UTC+10
Not yet

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:44pm UTC+10
oh um oh

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:44pm UTC+10
encrusted yet?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:44pm UTC+10
The stockpiles are almost full and they have 1530 spaces

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:44pm UTC+10
lovely

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:43pm UTC+10
I have several full stockpiles full of shell crafts

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:43pm UTC+10
Hmm

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:39pm UTC+10
I think I had the best day of my life today

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:39pm UTC+10
Okay

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:39pm UTC+10
lol

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:51pm UTC+10
Actually dw I'd say it'd be the magma moat

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 6:49pm UTC+10
Why are there random fires starting everywhere

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:29am UTC+10
But less pointy

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:29am UTC+10
Java is pretty much interpreter based C

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:04am UTC+10
Good plan

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:04am UTC+10
Because today other people are coming

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:04am UTC+10
And tomorrow

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:03am UTC+10
Mm

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:03am UTC+10
That's more cool

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:01am UTC+10
I'm going skating with Stacey today

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:01am UTC+10
:P

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:01am UTC+10
Yeah it is

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:01am UTC+10
That's cool

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:32am UTC+10
And just beat the crap out of EVERYTHING

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:31am UTC+10
And I'm gonna use the speed hacks and make loads of defences

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:31am UTC+10
I'm starting a world in a terrifying biome

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 8:24pm UTC+10
I like this command

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 8:24pm UTC+10
Nice

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 8:16pm UTC+10
About fourteen dwarves smoothed 400 tiles in under 3 seconds

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 8:16pm UTC+10
s fast

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 8:16pm UTC+10
Holy crap that'

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 8:15pm UTC+10
Pretty useful

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 8:15pm UTC+10
And it makes them teleport instead of walk

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 8:15pm UTC+10
It makes your dwarves do tasks really fast

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 8:15pm UTC+10
There's a DFHack command called fastdwarf

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 6:34pm UTC+10
That's really cool

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 6:31pm UTC+10
There's a ballista pointing down the main hallway and a moat ::D

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 6:30pm UTC+10
:D

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 6:30pm UTC+10
I'm under seige by my first goblin army in my first defendable fortress

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 6:30pm UTC+10
Woo

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 3:59pm UTC+10
Good games are good

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 3:59pm UTC+10
Yeah

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 3:59pm UTC+10
Orientation diversity is great though

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 3:59pm UTC+10
I knew that last bit

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 9:09am UTC+10
As Jess would say

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 9:09am UTC+10
Cuties :3

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 9:08am UTC+10
And if you make a bed and assign it to someon who's married both of them will be assigned to the bed

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 9:08am UTC+10
Asexual, bisexual, heterosexual, homosexual

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 9:07am UTC+10
Dwarves have sexual orientation and romantic orientation

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 9:07am UTC+10
Some things you may not know about DF

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 30, 2015 at 8:07am UTC+10
Watttt

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 10:26pm UTC+10
Golly gamolly

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 10:26pm UTC+10
Is segway spelt segue

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:48pm UTC+10
Crap he got out

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:38pm UTC+10
Vale

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:37pm UTC+10
Battery dying ttyl

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:37pm UTC+10
Me too

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:37pm UTC+10
I like it

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:37pm UTC+10
Anywose

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:37pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:36pm UTC+10
Eh

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:36pm UTC+10
To experiment

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:36pm UTC+10
Shoulda backed up while you could

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:35pm UTC+10
Huh

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:34pm UTC+10
Still not moving

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:34pm UTC+10
Nah he just went insane as you said that

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:34pm UTC+10
Hey try building a wall under him to stand on

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:33pm UTC+10
Weeeeellll maybe

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:31pm UTC+10
After several months

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:31pm UTC+10
He DEFINITELY should be by now

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:31pm UTC+10
That guy who got stuck in the tree isn't starving or dehydrated

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:31pm UTC+10
Hmm

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:30pm UTC+10
But now all winter is is a good time to make safe wells cause all the water's frozen

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:30pm UTC+10
That used to send shivers down my spine

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:30pm UTC+10
"Winter is upon you."

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:28pm UTC+10
Haha

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:27pm UTC+10
But that's good they're good workers when they can't see straight

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:26pm UTC+10
My dwarves: Go home, you're drunk

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:25pm UTC+10
wtf

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:25pm UTC+10
iron bed

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:25pm UTC+10
wait

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:24pm UTC+10
and a crappy wooden one there

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:24pm UTC+10
I want an iron bed of excellent quality there

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:24pm UTC+10
Like

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:24pm UTC+10
And you can set filters for each building

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:24pm UTC+10
*built

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:24pm UTC+10
As soon as they're made they'll be build

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:24pm UTC+10
You can construct some buildings (beds etc) without having the actual beds

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:23pm UTC+10
Planning mode

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:23pm UTC+10
Awesome, awesome DFHack feature:

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:17pm UTC+10
Thanks

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:17pm UTC+10
Oh ok

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:16pm UTC+10
I mean I don't care if you did just it's useful so if you didn't I help

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:15pm UTC+10
Yeah

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:15pm UTC+10
Do you know about shift + arrow keys?

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:09pm UTC+10
But but

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:04pm UTC+10
Ok go

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:04pm UTC+10
Right now

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:04pm UTC+10
I want to make a game with a community

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:03pm UTC+10
Cool cool

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:03pm UTC+10
That's it

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:03pm UTC+10
But 0008865

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:03pm UTC+10
That just causes severe lag

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:03pm UTC+10
I guess there aren't any steps needed to reproduce it so you aren't useful

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:02pm UTC+10
Yeah it has

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:02pm UTC+10
Maybe

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:02pm UTC+10
Although probably already discovered

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:01pm UTC+10
Yeah

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:01pm UTC+10
Yeah well

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:00pm UTC+10
As like proof

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:00pm UTC+10
Also backup the world before he dies

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:00pm UTC+10
But that's so good

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 5:00pm UTC+10
Yeah

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 4:59pm UTC+10
Report it tho

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 4:59pm UTC+10
THAT'S HILARIOUS

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 4:59pm UTC+10
HE'S JUST GONNA DIE OF STARVATION

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 4:59pm UTC+10
:DDD

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 4:59pm UTC+10
AND HE STAYED THERE

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 4:59pm UTC+10
:D

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 4:59pm UTC+10
So I took the stepladder away from underneath him

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 4:59pm UTC+10
And he didn't get down

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 4:59pm UTC+10
One of my dwarves got a strange mood whilst on a stepladder picking fruit

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 4:58pm UTC+10
YOu know the new stepladders?

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 4:58pm UTC+10
Jarvis

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 4:42pm UTC+10
Also

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 3:49pm UTC+10
I loathe that smiley

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 3:45pm UTC+10
:-P

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 3:45pm UTC+10
Sure I understood that vague and ambiguous statement

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 3:44pm UTC+10
Cheating just strips the game back to its engine which is um stuff

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 3:43pm UTC+10
Also in cases where cheating makes the difference between playing and not playing a game altogether, cheating is good

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 3:42pm UTC+10
Oh it is

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 3:42pm UTC+10
Cheating in DF would be amazing

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 3:41pm UTC+10
Considering the lack of aim of Dwarf Fortress neither do I

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 3:41pm UTC+10
Also I don't look down on cheating

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 3:41pm UTC+10
Ok

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 3:41pm UTC+10
Oh cool

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 3:40pm UTC+10
Priority mining is vanilla?

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 3:07pm UTC+10
Also priority-based mining :D

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:53pm UTC+10
Such as in the squad assignment screen it highlights dwarves who are already in your squad

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:52pm UTC+10
It adds some more functionality and user-friendly-ness

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:52pm UTC+10
If you don't cheat

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:52pm UTC+10
*great

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:52pm UTC+10
Is geat

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:52pm UTC+10
Also DFHack (whilst looked down upon for cheating)

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:51pm UTC+10
Cavern rush = easy

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:51pm UTC+10
Oh cool Joule

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:50pm UTC+10
Farm plots can see undiscovered underground places

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:50pm UTC+10
No

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:47pm UTC+10
Do you know about Dwarven Ground-Penetrating Radar?

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:39pm UTC+10
It is cool

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:39pm UTC+10
xD

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:39pm UTC+10
But yeah have fun

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:39pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:39pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:39pm UTC+10
Nah personality thing

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:39pm UTC+10
Like

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:39pm UTC+10
And I made the buttons light up different colors

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:39pm UTC+10
IT works

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 29, 2015 at 2:39pm UTC+10
Hey that sounds cool

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 9:47am UTC+10
I'm gonna make buttons trigger dwarf fortress macros

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 9:46am UTC+10
You know the Ableton Push?

Luke TuthillMonday, June 29, 2015 at 8:12am UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:47pm UTC+10
I don't want to talk about the wiki though

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:46pm UTC+10
Yes both

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:45pm UTC+10
Both rated D for Dwarf

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:33pm UTC+10
And collectively have no life

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:33pm UTC+10
Yeah

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:32pm UTC+10
And we could have multiple and swap

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:32pm UTC+10
But yes please

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:32pm UTC+10
I was thinking something like that though

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:32pm UTC+10
Exactly

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:30pm UTC+10
But we should do that

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:30pm UTC+10
K

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:29pm UTC+10
Google it when you can

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:29pm UTC+10
You can read the history

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:29pm UTC+10
The entire saga of Boatmurder is recorded

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:29pm UTC+10
Yeahhh

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:29pm UTC+10
Like copy the save

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:29pm UTC+10
Epizxccxx

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:29pm UTC+10
And they would continue

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:29pm UTC+10
Then at the next summer, that person would pass it on

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:28pm UTC+10
He would pass the game onto someone else

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:28pm UTC+10
He decided that each summer (every year)

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:28pm UTC+10
The fortress was called boatmurder

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:28pm UTC+10
So someone made a dwarf fortress save

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:28pm UTC+10
Ok

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:28pm UTC+10
No

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:28pm UTC+10
I think we should replicate it

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:28pm UTC+10
Welcome to the dark ages

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:28pm UTC+10
Have you heard of Boatmurder?

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:27pm UTC+10
He's a true role model

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:27pm UTC+10
Good for him

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:27pm UTC+10
Flashing red + icon and everything

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:26pm UTC+10
LIke a pro

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:26pm UTC+10
He's still mining

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:26pm UTC+10
Oh

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:26pm UTC+10
I've got a miner who's had a suture on a punctured lung

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:26pm UTC+10
Yeah! You go man!

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:21pm UTC+10
Make the farm and water before making the burrow

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:21pm UTC+10
Ok protip

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:18pm UTC+10
There's no benefit to starting mid siege why not just start again

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:18pm UTC+10
It doesn't involve burrows anyway because walls

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
Two problems

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
Like a built in retired fort

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
And siege forever

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
So if things go wrong you just main the hermit section

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
If it survives virtue of its small size, then it will by its design be siege ready

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
Dig in, consume or try again

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
So what

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
Then if it dies

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
:O

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
If you have a small buried fail safe, and it is independent and submerged and smaller

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
ah well

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
urgh

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
No I do have to worry about that

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
Ok

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
I don't even have to worry about a seperate food and water source because they're all there already

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
Wait

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:11pm UTC+10
Everythign I have is already there

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:11pm UTC+10
Make workshops and a farm and storage areas

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:10pm UTC+10
Dig out some stuff

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:10pm UTC+10
I find a free z-level

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:10pm UTC+10
For example I want to test minecarts

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:10pm UTC+10
Woah yeah

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:10pm UTC+10
Dwarf fortresses that have a failsafe mechanism for testing things

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
Starting meta-games

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
I just realised one great thing that burrows are for

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
Quick interruption

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
Yeah

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 8:12pm UTC+10
Do you remember amorphous

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:56pm UTC+10
K bye ttyl phone charging

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:54pm UTC+10
I only made two forts : P

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:53pm UTC+10
I think it's time for a break

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:53pm UTC+10
Also rogue likes get to a point where they are too show given an inevitable death anyway

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:51pm UTC+10
I'm not sure if I like DF : P

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:50pm UTC+10
It's pretty crazy how that happens

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:50pm UTC+10
with all this copper

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:50pm UTC+10
Yeah

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:50pm UTC+10
What am I going to do

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:50pm UTC+10
Several stockpiles worth

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:50pm UTC+10
Copper

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:50pm UTC+10
Much

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:50pm UTC+10
So

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:50pm UTC+10
So much copper

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:50pm UTC+10
I have

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:49pm UTC+10
Giving people numbers : P

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:49pm UTC+10
Well I should start renaming professional groups though

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:48pm UTC+10
K

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:48pm UTC+10
Squad-based management

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:48pm UTC+10
ORganisation

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:48pm UTC+10
If they're all busy what difference

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:47pm UTC+10
Too much micro

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:47pm UTC+10
Like when you have >200 dwarves

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:46pm UTC+10
Haha try using them normally

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:46pm UTC+10
Only emergencies and cruelty though

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:46pm UTC+10
And you're thinking awfully non-endgameishly

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:46pm UTC+10
Yes

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:46pm UTC+10
Have you used burrows?

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:45pm UTC+10
That's it

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:45pm UTC+10
But what do you need to ship it's like metal ore

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:45pm UTC+10
Works well with Burrows

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:45pm UTC+10
then unload it at the other end

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:44pm UTC+10
Have one dwarf push it

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:44pm UTC+10
You have them all put the items in a minecart

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:44pm UTC+10
instead of a whole bunch of dwarves bringing individual items to a stockpile

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:44pm UTC+10
Minecarts are awesome

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:40pm UTC+10
> . <

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:40pm UTC+10
Okay I've never had an unhappy dwarf anyway >.<

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
*dwarf

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
I haven't had a single unhappy dwarg

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
They will FLOCK to it in DROVES

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
Put like eight more statues in it

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
Make a statue garden out of it

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:38pm UTC+10
Stick it somewhere

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:38pm UTC+10
You make a statue

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:38pm UTC+10
I have found the perfect way to make dwarves happy

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:38pm UTC+10
Because they happen literally 100% of the time when you're going well

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:37pm UTC+10
I should start preparing for a goblin invasion

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:37pm UTC+10
Therefore

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:37pm UTC+10
Everything is awesome

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 25, 2015 at 5:37pm UTC+10
Ja

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 3:49pm UTC+10
Except I don't use it cause it's near the magma and not near the fort

I have a magma smelter

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 3:48pm UTC+10
Cages stack infinitely

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 3:48pm UTC+10
And now I have like six caged troglodytes and a troll in one cage

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 3:47pm UTC+10
I found a cavern

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 3:35pm UTC+10
Self-sufficient

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 3:35pm UTC+10
My fort is good

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 3:35pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:03am UTC+10
And I'm gonna starve him to death

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:03am UTC+10
I blocked off the room he claimed

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:03am UTC+10
Sooooo

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:02am UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:02am UTC+10
I had no silk cloth

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:02am UTC+10
He wanted silk cloth, logs and bones

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 9:02am UTC+10
A dwarf had a fey mood

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 24, 2015 at 4:59pm UTC+10
framerate drop is because I enabled the fps cap in the last one

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 24, 2015 at 4:59pm UTC+10
Wait

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, June 24, 2015 at 4:56pm UTC+10
Very cool yes

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, June 24, 2015 at 4:56pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 24, 2015 at 4:56pm UTC+10
How cool is the concept of retiring a fort?

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, June 24, 2015 at 4:55pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, June 24, 2015 at 4:55pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 24, 2015 at 4:52pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, June 24, 2015 at 4:51pm UTC+10
Using it it's magical

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 24, 2015 at 4:50pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 24, 2015 at 4:50pm UTC+10
What version of Dwarf Fortress are you running?

Luke TuthillSunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:17am UTC+10

Luke TuthillSunday, June 21, 2015 at 10:17am UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollSaturday, June 20, 2015 at 9:41pm UTC+10
Sorry about tengwar and how it never happened

Jarvis CarrollSaturday, June 20, 2015 at 9:41pm UTC+10
But mainly just when someone is better than you you never feel like your interests are invalid

Jarvis CarrollSaturday, June 20, 2015 at 9:40pm UTC+10
A bit yeah

Luke TuthillSaturday, June 20, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
:P

Luke TuthillSaturday, June 20, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
By 'social motivation' do you mean 'competition'?

Luke TuthillFriday, June 19, 2015 at 10:15pm UTC+10
Hahaha

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 19, 2015 at 10:15pm UTC+10
So now that there's social motivation I'm gonna get epikk

Luke TuthillFriday, June 19, 2015 at 10:08pm UTC+10
Oh awesome

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 19, 2015 at 10:08pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:44am UTC+10
Yeah sam and I got it

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:43am UTC+10
Or let U equal 2 to the x and solve for u

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:42am UTC+10
Take a log of both sides x equals 2log3 minus 3

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:34am UTC+10
HALP

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:32am UTC+10

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:32am UTC+10
xD

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:30am UTC+10
2^(2x) + 2^3 = (3^2)(2^x)

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:27am UTC+10
that's wrong

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:27am UTC+10

Wait

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:27am UTC+10
How do I solve 2^(x+3) = 9

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:27am UTC+10
Awesome

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:21am UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:27pm UTC+10
Apparently the router is having an existential crisis

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:27pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:23pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
Google searches work, nothing else though

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
It's connected

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
Physical devices? Dunno I'll check my phone

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
What devices are working

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
Doubt it

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
Maybe it has a battery in it?

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
The wifi signal is 4 bars

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
It's definitely runnig off the particular router that's off

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
I can't type the things I'm thinking so

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
That's so cool

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10
None of the profile pictures are loading

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10
So weird

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10
You're talking to devices on the other side directly

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10
The facebook website works

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:01pm UTC+10
Unplug it for science?

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:00pm UTC+10
I don't even know where to start

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 9:00pm UTC+10
Figure it out I wanna know

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
What the hell

Jarvis CarrollWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
Ah okay

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 8:58pm UTC+10
If I stop talking it means the router has started obeying the laws of data communication

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 8:58pm UTC+10
I don't actually know how I'm talking to you atm

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 17, 2015 at 8:58pm UTC+10
I technically don't have internet, but I appear to have bypassed the lack of connection

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 10:09pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 10:06pm UTC+10
okay cyan

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 10:05pm UTC+10
that's an anxious symptom if anything so it's a bit of a tangentr

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 10:05pm UTC+10
google images searching a colour and just seeing a page of sorted pretty things

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 10:05pm UTC+10
What

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 10:04pm UTC+10
do you know what I'm finding really satisfying now?

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:59pm UTC+10
: )

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:59pm UTC+10
Heh heh heh

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:59pm UTC+10
like associating colours with personality traits

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:59pm UTC+10
okay screw you now I'm seeing all the things that fit the autism description

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:52pm UTC+10
but eh everyone was sad at me going

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:46pm UTC+10
I was gunna say because we did it that way I felt it too

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:46pm UTC+10
yeah I was too

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:46pm UTC+10
I'm sure she was sad at you going

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:45pm UTC+10
meaning?

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:45pm UTC+10
Well I'm sure you two would have bonded at least slightly

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:45pm UTC+10
in the form of me flying away

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:44pm UTC+10
it's strange but we got as close as possible before we ended it

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:44pm UTC+10
Kathryn and I spent a weekend together prior to my flight out

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:42pm UTC+10
even if I am

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:42pm UTC+10
so it's not like anything matters cuz as you said it isn't measurable

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:42pm UTC+10
anyways I'm in a part of the spectrum where attempting to measure accurately can only result in detrimental failure in most cases

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:36pm UTC+10
like compared to medically diagnosing transgender people as having a psychological disorder is a bigger problem is what comes to mind

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:35pm UTC+10
Haha true

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:35pm UTC+10
I'm not complaining though, as far as medical disorder goes very high functioning autism isn't that offensive

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:34pm UTC+10
Yeah

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:34pm UTC+10
but medical explanations are what is wrong with the world

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:32pm UTC+10
Mmm

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:32pm UTC+10
but it's an elegant medical explanation of the feeling

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:32pm UTC+10
yeah obvs

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:32pm UTC+10
Above me I think but it's vague and not an actual measurable thing

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:31pm UTC+10
yeah maybe

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:31pm UTC+10
The autistic spectrum yeah

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:31pm UTC+10
of asperger's or something?

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:29pm UTC+10
I think that you're somewhere on the very high-functioning end of the spectrum

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:29pm UTC+10
I've been wondering for some time

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:28pm UTC+10
Yeah

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:28pm UTC+10
being disembodied makes me feel comfortable

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:28pm UTC+10
I like being able to talk to people as a disembodied voice

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:24pm UTC+10
Yeah

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:24pm UTC+10
oh yeah I didn't mean that you were

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:23pm UTC+10
I'm not doing anything yet

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:23pm UTC+10
I'm not doing anything wrong

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:23pm UTC+10
well morality is weird I don't feel like you're doing anything wrong

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
mm

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
Stacey would definitely want to be with me if I asked

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
I don't think I'm going to

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
Don't want to leave Aleesha

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
Just great

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
anyways how do you feel about that?

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
Uggggh

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
mm the world's a funny place

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
right

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
As opposed to Aleesha

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
And I can talk to her about literally anything

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
Really sexual conversations

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
hmm

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
We've been having deep conversations

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
Stacey

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
oh?

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
That I'm the apex of a love triangle

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
I think

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
but it's interesting because me leaving actually prolonged it, we would have completely ended earlier if we weren't given a date

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
so I ended up going to Hobart instead which was even more definite

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
things were fine in the superficial ways and it was hard to tell people when I was about to go to Tafe anyway

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
Yeah

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
because emotionally we were detaching and things were becoming bad in the important ways

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
Mm ok

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
we had already decided to stop treating our relationship like a relationship

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
Is it just because of your moving

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
I assumed as much

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
:(

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
but yeah we're over

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
she understands as well it's no big deal

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
nah it's fine really

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
excluding people Kath explained it to

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
Sorry I should have realised

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
that is what made me realize that only Sam knows

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
I assume this is about the cat post

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10
I was meaning to find out

Luke TuthillFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10
No

Jarvis CarrollFriday, June 12, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10
Hey Luke do you know what's up with Kath and I?

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 11, 2015 at 10:00pm UTC+10
Goodnight

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 11, 2015 at 9:51pm UTC+10
Those are my thoughts

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 11, 2015 at 9:51pm UTC+10
So yeah watch the pogobat one and then watch the liberal alternative he mentions

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 11, 2015 at 9:44pm UTC+10
Its a video response to his first one and I shared that response with Sam and Kathryn but she never watched it and he didn't for months and months

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 11, 2015 at 9:43pm UTC+10
By pogobat

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 11, 2015 at 9:42pm UTC+10
Watch "why I hate 'why I hate school but love religion'"

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 11, 2015 at 9:41pm UTC+10
The one he mentioned why I hate school but love education

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 11, 2015 at 9:41pm UTC+10
Much better than his first is what I said

Jarvis CarrollThursday, June 11, 2015 at 9:40pm UTC+10
I tried to comment but it went weird and I forgot to repost

Luke TuthillThursday, June 11, 2015 at 9:32pm UTC+10
Thoughts?

Luke TuthillThursday, June 11, 2015 at 9:32pm UTC+10
If so

Luke TuthillThursday, June 11, 2015 at 9:32pm UTC+10
Did you watch that video I mentioned you in?

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 7:03pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, June 10, 2015 at 7:03pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:36pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:36pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:36pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:36pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:36pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:36pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:35pm UTC+10
hmm I'm getting kinda chilly

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:35pm UTC+10
and then it becomes

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 3:35pm UTC+10
idk I just like look at a rock and then hop and rock and hop for a while

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 7:14am UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 7:13am UTC+10
Everything is instinctualised (???)

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 7:13am UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:37am UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 2:37am UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 6:03pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 6:03pm UTC+10
HTML as per normal

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 6:03pm UTC+10
Google django

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 6:03pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 6:03pm UTC+10
Well

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 6:03pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 6:03pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 6:02pm UTC+10
not overly

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 6:02pm UTC+10
You were never that interested in web dev, were you

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 6:01pm UTC+10
Ugh I have a headache and I left my laptop charger at school

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 6:00pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 6:00pm UTC+10
effort

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 6:00pm UTC+10
predictability

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 6:00pm UTC+10
monotony

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 6:00pm UTC+10
Why don't you like science pracs?

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 6:00pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 6:00pm UTC+10
idk we'll see let's not focus on the negatives

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 5:59pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 5:59pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 5:59pm UTC+10
I still have to do science prac

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 5:59pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 5:58pm UTC+10
Hmm

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 5:58pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 5:58pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 5:56pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 4:45pm UTC+10
Did you go to the school?

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 2, 2015 at 6:55am UTC+10
RTT?

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 1, 2015 at 6:56pm UTC+10
okay well RTT might be relevant

Luke TuthillMonday, June 1, 2015 at 6:55pm UTC+10
And I meant like turn based dungeon crawlers as well

Luke TuthillMonday, June 1, 2015 at 6:54pm UTC+10
It's a game

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 1, 2015 at 6:54pm UTC+10
ending??

Luke TuthillMonday, June 1, 2015 at 6:54pm UTC+10
Ending?

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 1, 2015 at 6:45pm UTC+10
so I would just call it cobalt-like

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 1, 2015 at 6:45pm UTC+10
I only know super hot and cobalt

Jarvis CarrollMonday, June 1, 2015 at 6:45pm UTC+10
there aren't that many the genre isn't named

Luke TuthillMonday, June 1, 2015 at 5:39pm UTC+10
Actually I still want to know

Luke TuthillMonday, June 1, 2015 at 5:38pm UTC+10
Wait no I found the game I was looking for

Luke TuthillMonday, June 1, 2015 at 5:37pm UTC+10
What's the word for games where time freezes unless you're moving?

Luke TuthillSunday, May 31, 2015 at 5:35pm UTC+10
Haha

Jarvis CarrollSunday, May 31, 2015 at 5:32pm UTC+10
thanks

Jarvis CarrollSunday, May 31, 2015 at 5:32pm UTC+10
preaching to the converted was thought-provoking

Jarvis CarrollSunday, May 31, 2015 at 5:25pm UTC+10
it's too motivational

Jarvis CarrollSunday, May 31, 2015 at 4:34pm UTC+10
that's cool

Luke TuthillSunday, May 31, 2015 at 4:30pm UTC+10
Google the pencilsword

Luke TuthillSunday, May 31, 2015 at 4:28pm UTC+10
Sorry I couldn't catch you at the end of friday

Luke TuthillSunday, May 31, 2015 at 4:27pm UTC+10
I don't think that there is a right worf for that

Luke TuthillSunday, May 31, 2015 at 4:27pm UTC+10
In fact

Luke TuthillSunday, May 31, 2015 at 4:26pm UTC+10
Pique was quite definitely not the right worf

Jarvis CarrollSunday, May 31, 2015 at 4:26pm UTC+10
how lovely

Luke TuthillSunday, May 31, 2015 at 4:26pm UTC+10
That may pique your friend list

Luke TuthillSunday, May 31, 2015 at 4:25pm UTC+10
I added you to a 6E group

Jarvis CarrollSunday, May 31, 2015 at 3:40pm UTC+10

Jarvis CarrollSunday, May 31, 2015 at 3:18pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSunday, May 31, 2015 at 3:18pm UTC+10

I'm now dead

Damo HurdSunday, May 31, 2015 at 8:24pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSunday, May 31, 2015 at 8:12pm UTC+10
Did you survive?

Luke TuthillSunday, May 31, 2015 at 8:12pm UTC+10
Did you finish it?

Damo HurdSunday, May 31, 2015 at 7:08pm UTC+10

Damo HurdSunday, May 31, 2015 at 7:07pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillSaturday, July 4, 2015 at 11:05am UTC+10
Mm okay

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:44pm UTC+10
I'm not ready yet, though

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:43pm UTC+10
Thank you

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:40pm UTC+10
I hope you find someone :)

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:39pm UTC+10
No, I haven't

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:33pm UTC+10
Have you every been in love, Maddi?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:28pm UTC+10
Mmm

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:28pm UTC+10
Just give it time, she'll hopefully come back around soon

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:27pm UTC+10
She knows

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:27pm UTC+10
Maybe try telling her you still want to be friends

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:27pm UTC+10
Have you spoken to her since?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:26pm UTC+10
Which I don't want her to do

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:26pm UTC+10
I suspect she's giving me room for Stacey

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:25pm UTC+10
Although I haven't talked to Aleesha in a while

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:25pm UTC+10
That's great, I'm happy for you then :)

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:25pm UTC+10
Absoluteley :)

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:25pm UTC+10
No problem. Are things going okay for you in regards to Aleesha and Stacey?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:24pm UTC+10
That means quite a lot to me

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:23pm UTC+10
Thank you

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:23pm UTC+10
Luke, message me any time you want to talk about sometimes, I'll try to just talk to you about it rather than shutting down the conversation

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:22pm UTC+10
Everybody does

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:21pm UTC+10
I get kind of defensive sometimes

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10
I'm sorry, I should have handled the situation better

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10
No at me

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10
At me?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:20pm UTC+10
I'm not depressed btw I'm just annoyed

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:19pm UTC+10
Much better

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:19pm UTC+10
I'm better at talking to computers than I am to people

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:18pm UTC+10
Most people know how to have a good conversation though

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:18pm UTC+10
People understand

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:18pm UTC+10
People say the wrong thing sometimes and that's okay

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:18pm UTC+10
No one knows how to have a perfect conversation with everyone they meet

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
Mmh

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
Until I figure out how to talk

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
I know this is difficult, I'm not going to pretend like I know what it's like, but I understand it would be hard for you. But please trust me when I say that those two conversations didn't seem abnormally unusual or weird, I would expect anyone to say that

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
But this isn't the first time and it won't be the last

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
Not to you

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
I'm sorry for making it seem like a big deal, it's not. Honestly

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
It's the fault of my condition

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
It

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
You're right, it's no one's fault

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
take the blame

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:11pm UTC+10
Don't you dare

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:11pm UTC+10
I'm sorry

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:11pm UTC+10
It's not your fault, I reacted badly

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:11pm UTC+10
My fault

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:11pm UTC+10
You can talk to me anytime okay? Just next time some warning maybe

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:11pm UTC+10
Mm and we're also not the closest of friends

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:11pm UTC+10
It was just a shock to me because we haven't spoken in a while and I didn't expect you to bring something like that up

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:10pm UTC+10
It's not like I was going to go into detail and the two other people I was speaking to at that time were fine with it I'm sorry I overestimated the trust and verbal intimacy we have

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:10pm UTC+10
I'm sorry for being rude

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
I didn't realise where the conversation was going and thought it was going to get worse so I tried to stop it there

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
This isn't your life

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
Not for you

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
It's honestly not a big deal

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
If not with you withy someone else

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
Yeah but it will happen again

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
Just let it go and I will too

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
Mmh that won't work

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10
No let's just forget about it

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10
Ah bloody hell

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10
And I won't talk to you again if you don't want me to

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
I'm really sorry

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
Just ignore me and my social ineptitude

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
You were rude to me the other night when I tried to tell you I didn't feel comfortable talking about your relationship life in detail, and now you've messaged me to tell me you don't approve of who I'm friends with?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
Ugh I'm sorry it happened again

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
Why did you message me just to harass me about my friends?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:04pm UTC+10
Idc who you are friends with

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:04pm UTC+10
Have you forgiven him?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:04pm UTC+10
*Like

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:04pm UTC+10
Likie

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:04pm UTC+10
I'm curious

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:04pm UTC+10
Oh it's not

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:04pm UTC+10
Why is who I'm friends with concern you?

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:04pm UTC+10
Why is this any of your business?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:03pm UTC+10
I don't understand how you can be friends with Jay knowing what he's done in the past

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:03pm UTC+10
Where's this going?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:03pm UTC+10
Mmh

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:03pm UTC+10
Our group just kind of fell apart after that whole incident and resulted in the group we have now, why?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:03pm UTC+10
or did you just sorta drift away

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:03pm UTC+10
Did you have a falling out?

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:02pm UTC+10
We were at the time though

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:02pm UTC+10
Not really anymore

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:02pm UTC+10
Are you friends with Ebony?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:02pm UTC+10
No nothing's happened recently to my knowledge

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:02pm UTC+10
I meant I know what happened in year nine but do you mean something new happened recently

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:01pm UTC+10
What do you mean 'what he's done'?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:01pm UTC+10
?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:01pm UTC+10
does it matter>

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:01pm UTC+10
In year nine or recently?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:01pm UTC+10
About Ebony

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:00pm UTC+10
I don't think so

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:00pm UTC+10
No?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:00pm UTC+10
Do you know what he's done

Maddi SchmaltzFriday, July 3, 2015 at 9:00pm UTC+10
I guess, why?

Luke TuthillFriday, July 3, 2015 at 8:55pm UTC+10
Are you friends with Jay?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:19pm UTC+10
There's the article for future reference

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
Goodbye

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
You infuriate me every time I talk to you

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
What did you need help with?

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
I'm sorry :(

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10

Bye, good luck with your problems!

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:17pm UTC+10
xD

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
Solved

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
I have to go

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
Problem

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
Umm

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
*one

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
Well pick the more important on (me)

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
There's also someone else trying to talk to me and it's weird trying to balance two conversations

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:16pm UTC+10
Oh no I won't

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
I just don't want to get into specifics

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
That stings

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
Why don't you want to talk to me anymore

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
Dunno

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
How much longer is this conversation going to go for?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
Also a shame

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
Ugh

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:15pm UTC+10
Safari

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
Using Chrome?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
that's a shame

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
I'm on my iPad

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
And google it in the window that pops up

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
Well just hit ctrl+shift+n

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:14pm UTC+10
Noted

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
Ahah okay

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
Just no

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
I'm not googling baseball metaphors for sex

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
I just used that Google definition thing

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
Please

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
Find it

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
No

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
did you find the wikipedia article?

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
Google is helping me

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
I like the base idea

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
No details

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:13pm UTC+10
Define broad

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
Let's just keep it broad shall we?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
I just assume everybody is and I don't like assuming

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
I'm sorry I didn't know how ready you were for sex related topics

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
Okay

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
I don't want to think!

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:12pm UTC+10
I meant things with stacey are progressing further than you probably think

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:11pm UTC+10
Nope

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:11pm UTC+10
Wait by further down the path was this while you were still with Aleesha?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:11pm UTC+10
Haha an awkward topic?

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:11pm UTC+10
The same guy I asked about the dating

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:11pm UTC+10
Umm how about we just move on?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:11pm UTC+10
And what do you mean confer with your college?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:10pm UTC+10
I wanna know

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:10pm UTC+10
Also when you find the article tell me the URL

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:10pm UTC+10
That was from memory shudup google "baseball metaphor for sex"

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
I have no internet at the moment so I couldn't test it

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
It says it doesn't exist

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
Yes

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
Did you try it?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
Yeah

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
That's not a real article

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:09pm UTC+10
I hand typed that so I think it's right

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_Metaphor_for_Sex

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
Hold on let me confer with my college again

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
I don't know what the bases are

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
xD

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
Bam

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:08pm UTC+10
BASE

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10
SECOND

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10
THINGS ARE FURTHER DOWN THE PATH THAN YOU UNDERSTAND

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10
We've both secretly wanted to be with each other since she had a crush on me

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10
URGH

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:07pm UTC+10
Just give it some time and see how you feel

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:06pm UTC+10
And vice versa

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:06pm UTC+10
I'm completely infatuated with Stacey

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:06pm UTC+10
Nothing 'should' happen, if you have feelings for Stacey then go be with Stacey

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
I feel like it should

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
Mmh

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
Does that hurt you?

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
Because I am not going to spend the next three hours trying to make my point

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
I'm not with Aleesha anymore

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
Is there another thing you need to say?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
What do you mean

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
I need to leave this conversation before I go crazy so hurry up and say what you want to say about Aleesha or Stacey

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:05pm UTC+10
That's not what a normal date would be like

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:04pm UTC+10
LIke

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:04pm UTC+10
OH MY GOD NOTHING IS MEANT TO HAPPEN

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:04pm UTC+10
and it's not what's meant to happen

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:04pm UTC+10
Like say you've liked them for ages, finally go on a date with them and they say something horrible to someone disabled or just generally put someone down

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:04pm UTC+10
That's not the majority of cases

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:04pm UTC+10
Well bad luck

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:04pm UTC+10
But what if something happens on the date that makes you realise their not the person you thought they were?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:03pm UTC+10
But that's different

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:03pm UTC+10
Unless it's blind dating

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:03pm UTC+10
The idea is that you go on a date with someone you like

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:03pm UTC+10
ANYWAY

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:03pm UTC+10
Urgh

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:03pm UTC+10
Okay what is your main point?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:03pm UTC+10
No

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:02pm UTC+10
YOU LITERALLY SAID, "DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?"

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:02pm UTC+10
Not everything involves you

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:01pm UTC+10
God Maddi

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:01pm UTC+10
No I was talking about myself

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:01pm UTC+10
HOW AM I BEING DISCRIMINATORY BY SAYING I AM STRAIGHT??

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:01pm UTC+10
The idea is that you go on a date with someone you like

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:01pm UTC+10
Well

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:01pm UTC+10
Let's not be discriminatory

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:01pm UTC+10
I am straight and no I do not

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:01pm UTC+10
Or ambiguous sexed friend

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:00pm UTC+10
Say you go on a date and then decide you hate the person?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:00pm UTC+10
Girlfriend

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:00pm UTC+10
Or

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:00pm UTC+10
Do you have a boyfriend?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:00pm UTC+10
And that's not how I think things should work or how things work at the moment

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:00pm UTC+10
Alright

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 9:00pm UTC+10
Back to being somewhat serious

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
That's never what's happened to me

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
It was a hypothetical

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
Don't worry he doesn't know what I'm talking about

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
Sets my teeth on edge

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
I have just conferred with a college, and HE AGREES THAT YOU GO ON A DATE AND THEN MAKE DECISIONS

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
Oh I've MISSED talking to you

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
Oh I

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
But I'm not

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:59pm UTC+10
I would say I'm sorry

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:58pm UTC+10
Two can play at this shaming game buddy -- don't be racist.

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:58pm UTC+10
Okay um no you just attempted to ridicule me

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:58pm UTC+10
xD

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:57pm UTC+10
Just because I have Aspergers doesn't mean you can ridicule my social ineptitude \

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:57pm UTC+10
Well I'm sorry

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:57pm UTC+10
You ask her out, go on a date, and then ask her to be your girlfriend

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:57pm UTC+10
You don't just ask a girl out and then expect you're together

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:57pm UTC+10
*TO

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:57pm UTC+10
YES WO ALL YOUR QUESTIONS

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:57pm UTC+10
ANYWAY

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:57pm UTC+10
;)

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:56pm UTC+10
Making you exasperated gives me pleasure

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:56pm UTC+10
Hahaha

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:56pm UTC+10
I MEANT MORE THAN ONCE YOU IDIOT

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:56pm UTC+10
Your question: "Do you want to go out with her?" you say after SEEING US ON THE DATE

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:55pm UTC+10
Two separate questions

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:55pm UTC+10
Honestly

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:55pm UTC+10
Asking to be together comes after asking to go on a date

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:55pm UTC+10
excuse me

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:55pm UTC+10
You can go on a date and never turn it into something

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:55pm UTC+10
Rekd

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:55pm UTC+10
Maddi I have aspergers and I'm better at social situations than you

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:55pm UTC+10
No.

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:54pm UTC+10
Ugh isn't that what kissing and going on a date implies most of the time

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:54pm UTC+10
Like boyfriend-girlfriend you idiot

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:54pm UTC+10
Honestly maddi

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:54pm UTC+10
Well I'd say so considering we just did

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:53pm UTC+10
Do you want to go out with her?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:53pm UTC+10
Considering I kissed her back

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:53pm UTC+10
I'd say so

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:52pm UTC+10
Are you interested in Stacey?

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:52pm UTC+10
So

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:52pm UTC+10
Alright

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:52pm UTC+10
xD

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:52pm UTC+10
There was more stuff but I'm not close enough to you to tell you

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:52pm UTC+10
fairly evenly

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:51pm UTC+10
Spread out

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:51pm UTC+10
Not like in a short time space

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:51pm UTC+10
Okay I'm catching on

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:51pm UTC+10
Six kisses

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:51pm UTC+10
That was a date

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:51pm UTC+10
Wow I stopped typing and hit send by accident

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:51pm UTC+10
If you have feelings for Stacey and are ready for a relationship with her than go for it, but if you're

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:51pm UTC+10
Considering she kissed me at least six times on our "first date" today

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:50pm UTC+10
I assume so

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:50pm UTC+10
Stacey

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:50pm UTC+10
But she's not ready

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:50pm UTC+10
Aleesha yes

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:50pm UTC+10
Both

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:50pm UTC+10
Stacey?

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:50pm UTC+10
Do you know if she's still into you?

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:50pm UTC+10
Oh okay

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:50pm UTC+10
Mm

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:49pm UTC+10
Oh

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:49pm UTC+10
And by "broke up" I mean she said "you should go out with Stacey"

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:49pm UTC+10
Tension built up over Assessment week (woohoo best time for it) and after the physics test we "broke up"

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:48pm UTC+10
And I've been having problems with Aleesha over the past ages like since camp

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:48pm UTC+10
Ok she had john and matt

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:48pm UTC+10
Soooo

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:48pm UTC+10
Yes continue

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:47pm UTC+10
anyway

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:47pm UTC+10
֏ is the symbol for useless points

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:47pm UTC+10
I'll work my way to first don't worry

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:47pm UTC+10
Beating you is "That guy in Europe that gave me three extra plat on a trade in Warframe" at 50 ֏ and Harold the Robot at 30 million ֏

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:46pm UTC+10
Congrats

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:46pm UTC+10
You're coming third

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:46pm UTC+10
Thanks 󾆴🏽

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:45pm UTC+10
*sec

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:45pm UTC+10
I'll just add that to my score list 1 secd

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:44pm UTC+10
twenty-three useless points to you

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:44pm UTC+10
That's correct and in the right order

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:44pm UTC+10
I think the first had curly hair (don't know if he was John or Matt) and the second was tall with dark hair

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:44pm UTC+10
I know

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:44pm UTC+10
But okay

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:44pm UTC+10
I don't know John or Matt

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:43pm UTC+10
Anyway she was with john for a while and then matt

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:43pm UTC+10
Hmm.....

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:43pm UTC+10
Word for word

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:43pm UTC+10
That's exactly what Kassidy said

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:43pm UTC+10
Everyone makes mistakes, it's okay

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
I handled it badly

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
Which was heartless of me and I regret that every day

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
*so

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
Fo I friendzoned her for Aleesha

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
Okay sorry

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:42pm UTC+10
Be patient

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:41pm UTC+10
Are you interested in her?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:41pm UTC+10
She had a crush on me last year

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:41pm UTC+10
So

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:41pm UTC+10
Okay

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:41pm UTC+10
Butttttt at the back of my head there's the thought maybe she dumped him fo rme

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:40pm UTC+10
The guy, not Stacey!!

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:40pm UTC+10
Okay wow dirtbag

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:40pm UTC+10
And I think she was being honest

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:40pm UTC+10
She says that he dumped her because "she didn't love him enough"

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:40pm UTC+10
Not anymore

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:40pm UTC+10
Isn't she seeing someone in her year?

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
No, I don't think so

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
Wait, now I'm confused

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
Do you know my history with Stacey

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
Stacey

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
But

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
She still likes me too

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
Well you did see today

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:39pm UTC+10
It'll be okay, year 11 and 12 will be hard for both of you but maybe afterward you'll both be ready for a relationship

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
brb

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
Crap my dwarves are out of food

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
Unacceptable

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
Have you even read the little prince

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:38pm UTC+10
And childish questions are the best

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:37pm UTC+10
Yeah

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:37pm UTC+10
This sounds like a childish question, but do you still like her?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:37pm UTC+10
She said (and I've known for a loooooong time) that she wasn't ready for a relationship

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
No okay it was a happy breakup

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
I think I'll live *hand on heart*

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
Yeah

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
Are you alright?

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
Like anymore or?

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
Okay?

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
Oh yes sorry continue

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
Aren't a thing

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
Confess anyway

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
Aleesha and I

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
Anyway

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
So I *think* they're bluffing

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:36pm UTC+10
Of course it does

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:35pm UTC+10
The only remotely-viewable camera in this house is the size of a shoebox and makes a loud noise and lights up

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:35pm UTC+10
Thanks 󾆶🏽

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:35pm UTC+10
Anyway

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:35pm UTC+10
Okay

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:35pm UTC+10
I love it

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:34pm UTC+10
You're as cruel as ever

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:34pm UTC+10
Hahahahah

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:34pm UTC+10
Because then they will get scared and you can just sit in your room and laugh but really you'll actually be crying because you just murdered someone

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:33pm UTC+10
I am totally confused

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:33pm UTC+10
Explain?

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:33pm UTC+10
Please

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:32pm UTC+10
Um

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:32pm UTC+10
?

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:32pm UTC+10
Sorry

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:32pm UTC+10
Like confess to a murder

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:32pm UTC+10
Do something really really something

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:31pm UTC+10
I think they've planted a camera in here

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:31pm UTC+10
Cursed be their names

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:31pm UTC+10
My brother and his friend

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:31pm UTC+10
Ugh one second

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:30pm UTC+10
She just seems like one of those genuinely lovely people

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:30pm UTC+10
I like her, she's very sweet

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:30pm UTC+10
So how was your day with Stacey?

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:30pm UTC+10
Hahaha

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:30pm UTC+10
Butttt

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:30pm UTC+10
And I would have been perfectly happy to do so

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:30pm UTC+10
I was just gonna shout hellooooo

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:29pm UTC+10
Oh cool

Maddi SchmaltzWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:28pm UTC+10
Hey 󾌵 Sorry, I saw your message as I was about to get into the shower so I decided to wait to message you back

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:21pm UTC+10

Luke TuthillWednesday, July 1, 2015 at 8:19pm UTC+10
Hello

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 8:14pm UTC+10
I asked because I wasn't there

Luke TuthillTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 4:06pm UTC+10
That's good

Maddi SchmaltzTuesday, June 9, 2015 at 4:04pm UTC+10
Good?

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 5:17pm UTC+10
Do you know semitone patterns for a bunch of scales? ie Major is 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1 1 is a semitone, 2 is a tone

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 9:21am UTC+10
so (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 8) = 0

Craig SmithThursday, June 18, 2015 at 9:21am UTC+10
oh cool

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 9:21am UTC+10
Which is solvable to get (y-1)(y-8) = 0

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 9:20am UTC+10
then you get y^2 + 9y + 8 = 0

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 9:20am UTC+10
if you let y = 2^x

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 9:20am UTC+10
AKA (2^x)^2 + 9(2^x) + 8 = 0

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 9:20am UTC+10
4^x + 9(2^x) + 8 = 0

Craig SmithThursday, June 18, 2015 at 9:19am UTC+10
i'm confused

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 9:19am UTC+10
*y^2

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 9:19am UTC+10
with y = x^2 it goes to y^ + 9y + 8

Craig SmithThursday, June 18, 2015 at 9:19am UTC+10
?

Craig SmithThursday, June 18, 2015 at 9:19am UTC+10
to where

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 9:19am UTC+10
You had to sub in x^2

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 9:18am UTC+10
the original question was 4^x + 9(2^x) + 8 = 0

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 9:18am UTC+10
Oh no sam and I got it

Craig SmithThursday, June 18, 2015 at 9:15am UTC+10
if the pronumerals are exponents, try making the bases the same

Craig SmithThursday, June 18, 2015 at 9:15am UTC+10
hrm?

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:35am UTC+10
Halp!

Luke TuthillThursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:35am UTC+10
2^(2x) + 2^3 = 9(2^x)?

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 7:01pm UTC+10
That's so annoying

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 7:01pm UTC+10
Arrrgh

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 7:01pm UTC+10
I have two male cats

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 7:01pm UTC+10
No

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 7:01pm UTC+10
Crap

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:48pm UTC+10
I have a male and female cat

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:48pm UTC+10
Now

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:48pm UTC+10
I jsut traded for a cat

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:41pm UTC+10
Also I thinik it's the page where it says how you win

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:41pm UTC+10
That has teh most Fun projects on it

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:41pm UTC+10
Go to the page 'stupid dwarf tricks'

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:39pm UTC+10
That's the game site

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:38pm UTC+10
They are

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:37pm UTC+10
No need for water, just booze and a profession for desexinf? They sound like the superior species to me

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:37pm UTC+10
And you don't want unhappy dwarves

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:37pm UTC+10
In fact while they can survive on water, they get unhappy if they don't get alcohol

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:37pm UTC+10
They can literally survive on boose

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:37pm UTC+10
They don't need water to survive

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:36pm UTC+10
Yeah they do

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:36pm UTC+10
Good job dwarves, they have their priorities straight

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:36pm UTC+10
There's a dwarf profession called gelder that specifically desexes male animals

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:36pm UTC+10
There's a hell cavern?

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:36pm UTC+10
It's not like they open the Hell cavern

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:35pm UTC+10
Damn someone better desex them

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:35pm UTC+10
Well, seriously but not literally

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:35pm UTC+10
Seriously

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:35pm UTC+10
Yeah

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:35pm UTC+10
Seriously? Frisky kitties and everything goes to hell?

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:35pm UTC+10
Cats covering literally every tile

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:35pm UTC+10
It's a common reason for a fortress to fall

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:34pm UTC+10
Cat breeding is a bit wacky at the moment

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:34pm UTC+10
That's what I would do

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:34pm UTC+10
Which if you have a male and female cat at any point in the game, you will

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:34pm UTC+10
Or you could make a nest out of them and hibernate

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:34pm UTC+10
Which is a convenient way to dispose of spare cats you have lying around

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:34pm UTC+10
Ooh but so does the catapult

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:34pm UTC+10
Bridge a pult sounds fun

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:33pm UTC+10
cats

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:33pm UTC+10
which is like a bridgeapult but with specific ammo

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:33pm UTC+10
Then making a catapult

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:33pm UTC+10
Making a bridge-a-pult (like a drawbridge but better)

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:33pm UTC+10
capturing a megabeast (cave dragon, bronze collossus, giant cave spider etc.) and putting it in a zoo for your dwarfish children to watch

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:32pm UTC+10
:)

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:32pm UTC+10
BONFIRE OF FLESH

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:32pm UTC+10
Kill 100 dwarves in the time space of one tick

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:31pm UTC+10
have 100 dwarves simultaneously on fire

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:31pm UTC+10
Goddamn goblin armies too small for your power

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:31pm UTC+10
Other ways to win:

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:31pm UTC+10
And flood everything with magma

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:31pm UTC+10
FARM FIR FOOD AND BOOZE IM IN

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:31pm UTC+10
waiting for the first decent-sized goblin army to come and attack

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:30pm UTC+10
Things like piping the contents of a magma pump to the surface via screw pumps, then building a lava-proof stronghold, putting all your dwarves in it with a farm for food and booze

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:29pm UTC+10
:D

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:29pm UTC+10
Exactly like life :)

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:29pm UTC+10
Haha true

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:29pm UTC+10
Like life

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:29pm UTC+10
Most of them involve murdering a large amount of creatures in a very short time

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:29pm UTC+10
But there are unconventional and unofficial ways to win

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:29pm UTC+10
Logic

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:28pm UTC+10
Dwarf fortress = losing and dwarf fortress is fun therefore losing is fun

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:28pm UTC+10
It's a nice change from everything else on earth

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:28pm UTC+10
Therefore

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:27pm UTC+10
And any game that goes on for an arbitrarily long time is boring

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:27pm UTC+10
Good

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:27pm UTC+10
Well it wouldn't be fun if it weren't a risk

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:27pm UTC+10
There's no end

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:27pm UTC+10
Well, you can't actually win the game

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:27pm UTC+10
And 'Fun' almost always means deadly

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:27pm UTC+10
That's a good attitude to hold

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:27pm UTC+10
The page for 'Losing' redirects to 'Fun'

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:26pm UTC+10
is a topic quite frequently mentioned in the wiki for Dwarf Fortress

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:26pm UTC+10
You're so funny

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:26pm UTC+10
Fun

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:26pm UTC+10
Good spelling

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:26pm UTC+10
Funny you should mention Fun

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:26pm UTC+10
It's like the most beautifool game ever

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:26pm UTC+10
Like a circuit board of fun

Luke TuthillThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:26pm UTC+10
Oh it is

Essa DeverThursday, June 25, 2015 at 6:25pm UTC+10
It still looks fun
